"bhool bhulaiyaa 1 powerful film, Akshay's acting is great, the plot is powerful. bhool bhulaiyaa 2 is too pretentious. If you remove the pathos, then the average score, Kartik overacted. The scene where Manzhulika picks up a man and throws it is generally a catastrophe, horror, how can such a film be spoiled with such terrible unprofessional scenes. Bhool bhulaiyaa 3 make sure to fix these points and make the movie more realistic and make sure to bring Akshay Kumar back in the movie.",Negative

"This movie is generational. This is where the MCU peaked. Infinity War is objectively a better movie, but Endgame is the best MCU project. It understood what Infinity War was, understood that the Snap was going to change the MCU forever. Memorials were raised. Lives were upended. People lost everything and that broke the world. Then Phase 4 comes around and everything is back to normal. 

They should've spent all of Phase 4 continuing this tone of change and defeat. Screw the Multiverse, street level consequences would flesh out the world much more. What supervillains have risen in the 5 years? What superheroes have? How will society handle 3.5 billion people coming back at once? How has street crime changed? What will happen when the snapped crime boss comes back to take his seat? There's so much to say, but instead we get dumb jokes like ""Infinity Cones"" and an immediate jump to the Next Big Thing with no thought behind how attached we are to the Next Big Thing",Negative
"movie was pathetic. Nothing like the first. They had out of nowhere a ""famous"" music festival in manali with Back dancers wearing Bikini in snow. The first one made a lot of sense.

"10 years have passed and I still can't get over the fact that they have called him Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga is kind of an old hag forest witch who likes to snack on kids. Baba literally means a woman. It sounds so stupid it's cringe. I bet they thought it sounded like a bogeyman, and there is a character exactly analogous used to scare little kids called Babay. 
Ok, BUT there is another fairytale character called Kashchey, or in full Kashchey the Undying. He is a king - tall, slim, dressed in black with a long hair, he commands death and cannot be killed by regular means. Reminds of someone from this movie?
Given Russian speaking actors in the movie it's double stupid. Those are fairitales every kid knows, it's not an obscure lore. They should definetely know that Baba Yaga is an absolute miss.",Negative

"The first episode of John Wick was more or less acceptable, the second one boring, the third one bad. The fourth part is extremely bad, even ridiculous. Why? Well, I watched the full three hours and saw an endless sequence of villains being murdered, preferably by being shot in their head. John is indestructible; he fell from a 4 floor building, a 222 step stairs, was being run over several times by cars and bikes but our man keeps on running and fighting. He even survives an attack by an huge army of heavily armed criminals. Fortunately John is wearing a bulletproof costume so he can hide his head in his jacket whenever needed.

Cheesy!
Very disappointed.",Negative
"I know movies aren't supposed to be realistic but this was the most ridiculous film I've ever seen, obviously I'm in a minority as most comments are very positive. He has thousands of bullets heading his way & not 1 hits his hand that's holding his jacket. And how the heck did he get to the top of the steps in a couple of minutes. I know films are escapism but Jesus this was too much nonsense, or maybe I'm just getting old!",Negative

It got to the point where it felt like the whole plot of the movies was just killing as many people as possible, for no real reason. By the time I watched part 4, I couldn't even remember the first three, or what the whole story was. Everybody was just killing everyone constantly. It got SO repetitive.

Does anyone else think the whole blind man ninja master or whatever he is meant to be ruined john wick 4. No disrespect to blind people whatsoever but there is no way a blind man would be able to do what this guy does in this film. He would get shot in the head within five seconds but no in this film he knows where guns are being aimed and where swords are swinging and he finds his way round the city no problem and knows everything that's going on around him. What a load of bullshit.unless he is not blind and was just pretending to be blind then the film is just crap to me wich is a shame cuz i love the first three films. And if he is not blind but is just pretending then they should have made this clear to the veiwers .,Negative

"Many say: ""Wow, how can they move like this when 60+?!"", but suddenly forget they have stand-ins for many of these moves, and they dont even need that anymore with good new AI-assisted animation/cutting. 
Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) was an early example of where the movie industry is going in the future; who needs actors when Clark Gable & Anthony Quinn can star main roles in new AAA movies? Scary.
Personally, I'm considering going blind, obviously it's so much easier being a super-martial artist then.

"As soon as someone uses the term ""woke"" you already know that their opinion is worthless. Because wtf do you mean weak story and weak acting? Keanu Reeves was never a good actor, he made a career on  likeability and looks. The reason he is so loved in John Wick is his stunt work which he takes incredibly seriously despite approaching 60. And the stories of these films always been weak. The first revolves around a dead dog and the others (especially the 3rd) is just a manhunt. Tell me that Reeves has slowed down because of age, that the presence of so many martial artists reduces John's badass factor, that the film and the fight scenes are too long or that you feel the Marvelification of the franchise  and I could have taken you seriously. But woke?",Negative

"These were incredible movies. But if thereâ€™s one thing I want Secret Wars to improve on itâ€™s the length of the final battle.
1. Endgame had a huge final battle with everyone there. It was great, but the entire sequence lasts 11 mins, which isnâ€™t bad but it got right to the point fairly quick and skimmed over several characters who were there.
2. Endgameâ€™s finale feels and is much faster than Infinity Warâ€™s, youâ€™d think itâ€™d be opposite.
3. Doomsday will likely have a big final battle with many characters, but I assume that Secret Wars will be a far bigger one with everybody, somewhat replicating Endgame having everybody of its time. 
4. So I hope that if Secret Wars has a huge final battle with everybody present, that they make it longer than Endgameâ€™s (from the point everybody on both sides arrived for war). A few thoughts:
- A long single cut (1 min or so) spanning across the battle field that shows everyone doing something
- Make sure everybody is shown in action (Endgame skipped several who were there but didnâ€™t have action on screen)
- Endgameâ€™s was 11 mins, I hope Secret Wars finale is closer to 25-30 because itâ€™ll have more characters and is a bigger finale",Negative

In my country ""Pakistan"" alot of people called it slow, boring and hard to understand but i cant comprehend in words what joy i felt after watching this movie. I was the only guy in the cinema hall who cheered when Arthur danced after killing those three guys, who felt bad when arthur was in pain and who felt relieved and clapped in the last scenes when Arthur was standing on the top of the car, accepting his destiny. That day i came home and my wife saw a very different side of me, because she couldnt understand why i was so connected to the movie...i cried and cried and cried that day because all that was in my past came back crashing in my mind...i was bullied all childhood and teenage. I never knew why being innocent and not hurting anyone was taken as symbol of weakness... this movie took out my vulnerabilities and washed them away which i had controlled over the years.

"Dreaming about Mr. Amitabh Bachchan! ğŸ˜ğŸ«£

In the dream, there is a pair of sisters and brothers. Their father is an evil magician. For his own purpose, he even used the weakness of the sister and brother's brother to accomplish it!

In order to save her younger brother who has been controlled by her father's magic, the older sister fights against the evil magician together with Mr. Amitabh Bachchan!

Just when the battle was intense to the critical moment (the battle was super exciting), I saw Mr. Amitabh Bachchan suddenly shouted ""(the name of this character; the name of the sister's brother)""!!!!!

In my dream, I saw a building that seemed to be similar to the Pont du Gard as the background location of the battle!",Negative

"I re-watched the movie maybe 3-5 times and I came to realize that in the plot the joker is the definition of ""anarchy"". Like when he doew not intend to start a movement ... he sparks to life a de jour chaos of discontent. Even his ""followers"" are not following him they are just part of the discontent, the anarchy. So when later the Batman comes around the Joker needs not to ""organize"" any help around him... he just again rides a new wave of disconetnt. When confronted by Batman the Joker instesd knows that his parents were not killee by a mugger, but by ""some pissed off guy"". Bruce Wayne goes on to repress that memory and believed he or his alter-ego Batman was born out of necessity to fight crime, and when confronting the Joker he looks at him as a criminal and never fully understands what the Joker understood: that just like the Joker they are both children of misfortune and anarchy. Antithetical - yet, in a sense, brothers.",Negative

"State an hypothesis that a scientist in movies is either evil or killed as a good guy henchman as a trope because the scientist is perceived as a modern materialist as compared to the noble savage or the knight in Armor? Give 5 lines
The scientist in movies is often portrayed as either evil or sacrificed as a good guy henchman due to the prevailing trope that associates them with modern materialism. This stereotype contrasts with the romanticized ideals of the noble savage or the knight in armor, embodying a clash between progress and tradition in storytelling. The scientist's pursuit of knowledge and technological advancements is frequently depicted as a threat to the natural order, perpetuating a narrative that resonates with broader societal anxieties about scientific progress and its potential consequences. This trope reflects a dichotomy between scientific rationality and more traditional, heroic archetypes, shaping audience perceptions of characters in these roles.

Well, that's how I felt watching this. Are you freaking kidding me? The guys he fights are these oddly shaped gargantuan guys wearing giant gogo boots so we don't notice how slow he's gotten. When he's fighting more than one guy the one he's not facing is doing weird sh*t to waste time until he turns around. It's ridiculous. Any slower & he'd be in reverse. It's like they got everyone from the first 3 to make a straight-to-video version, and then managed to get it into theaters. I just started watching it today, & I can't even finish it. My favorite movies are B-grade, cheesey 80's, independent and foreign & this movie is friggin dumb. The guys in here, I think, are from the same casting company they used to use in older Jackie Chan movies. Same place they found the ""Russian"" in ""The Punisher."" Really big, really dumb, and really slow. It's actually sad watching this. I love Keanu Reeves, and I have been watching him since the 80's, but he needs to be done with John Wick or the next one will take place in the nursing home. I'm just going to forget I even seen half of it, and try to remember him for the ass-kicking assassin he was in the first 3.",Negative

"The Lord wants sinners to come to Him in repentance, that's why God the Father came as Jesus Christ in the flesh to save and reconcile us back to Him ( Romans 5)! He came to save us from sin's damnation and cure us from it's curse and set us free from it's bondage and give us life, healing, freedom and forgiveness and redemption and salvation by Him and His Holy Spirit ( Luke 4:18-19)! Jesus went as the lamb of God and made Himself as a sacrificial offering for our sins, He went and took all of our sins and God's wrath on the cross, He took God's Holy hatred that was for us because of our sins and He took that for us on the cross even though He was and is innocent and we was and are guilty! Jesus never sinned, He kept all of God's Holy law and never broke one ( Matthew 5:17, 1 Peter 2:22) but we didn't do like Christ, we human beings disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit, we brought sin into the world because of our disobedience towards God our Holy Heavenly Creator and Father! but Jesus took all of our guilt, shame, sin to the cross and suffered God's wrath, our punishment, our sins for us on that cross and all the pain, insults, and beatings He went through could not dare compare to God's wrath He went through and yet what's astounding about this is that He didn't have to do it He didn't have to take you and my sin to the cross He didn't have to suffer our punishment for us, He could have called a legion of Holy angels and have us destroyed, He could have went back to Heaven and we all perished in our sins But BUT Because of His love and mercy He has for us He went through it all on the cross and died and paid for our sin debt and penalty in full, He  the rose again on the third day with glory and power and triumph and conquered hell, sin, death, satan, and the world and broke down the wall that separated us from the Him. we are unworthy of all that Jesus did for us but He did it for us anyway! that is true love and that same true love is calling all sinners to repentance. Jesus is the only way to Heaven and Salvation and He has His hand out offering salvation and forgiveness of sin and redemption to everyone, Let's pray they'll answer His call and come to Him and turn from their sin and turn to Him for salvation, forgiveness of sin and redemption that He offers to everyone everyday and that the same people will surrender their all to Him and become born again by the Holy Spirit ( John 3:3-8, John 14:6) Amen",Negative

"A terrible final chapter in the trilogy. I would say i'm disgusted and if it were possible, I would want my money back. The audience has been truly cheated. This was not even 15% of either of the first 2 installments and a true insult to them. The ONLY HIGHLIGHT was the DOG.

The director destroyed the brand and should never be supported with this genre again. EVERY fight scene was so poor, that it could have been made by a clueless beta-male who knows ZERO about hand-to-hand combat. Enemies making a move, then freezing, so that Wick could finish them.  It was PURE McDojo Bullshit, and the 'Ken Doll bodyguards' in grey were complete overkill and deserving only of derision. CGI was used to an obnoxious extent and the storyline was so poor and lacking any viewer engagement, that if it were a free film, I would have stopped watching after the first ridiculous 30 minutes. A cheaply made studio green-screen film, that was quickly written on a Friday afternoon. Shame on Keanu Reeves for accepting it.

Yes.. it ruins the 1st movieâ€¦ literally the entire buildup of the 1st movie is destroyed cause we donâ€™t see the Joker at all in the 2nd film.

"Somewhere in West Philadelphia, you will find an old basketball court with a single ball lying in the middle. Pick it up, and start shooting hoops. After a while, a small group of hooligans will approach you and challenge you to a fight, which you must accept.

After the fight, you must go home and relay the events to your mother. She will then inform you that you have an aunt and uncle living in one of the districts of Los Angeles, and out of fear, she will send you to live there for an indefinite period of time.

With your bags packed, go to the street corner, and whistle for a cab. The cab that pulls up will bear the word â€œFRESHâ€ on the license plate, and upon closer inspection, novelty fuzzy dice will hang in the mirror. Although you will suddenly realize that cabs like these are extremely hard to find, do not bear any thought to it. At this point, you must point out in front of the car and say â€œYo, homes, to Bel Air.â€

You will stop in front of a mansion, and it will be sometime between 7 and 8 oâ€™clock, even though it will feel like you have been travelling for mere seconds. Get your luggage out and say â€œYo, homes, smell ya later!â€ but do not turn back to face the cabby. Walk up to the door, look over your shoulder once, and then knock on the door three times.

If you follow these instructions, your life will get flip-turned upside-down.",Negative

Who is this guy??  are we present day??  After a while i didn't care.  Cillian Murphy's portrayal was gimmicky.  Nolan decision to do the Atomic Bomb with a truck full of gasoline was insanely dumb.  As soon as the bomb went off I just rolled my eyes.  it looked nothing like an atomic detonation.  And then there was another hour of dry conversations at a desk.   It was a yawn fest.

I've been to the Hiroshima museum and also Nagasaki (Hiroshima has the better one). Everyone should see this. Civilians died in the most cruel ways. women, children. This is the worst way to die, from radioactivity. The body is already dead, but the person is still walking. Maggots in the body, internal bleeding, vomiting, slow organ failure, etc. Then disabled children were born after the war, or children died of leukemia. Americans sent their doctors who constantly examined everything like a human experiment. Yes, that went down in history. I repeat: This was truly the greatest war crime in human history.",Negative

The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 are said to have killed approximately 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 74,000 people in Nagasaki including over 38,000 of kids and baby by the end of 1945.

"I argue that in ancient China and Korea such tone of music  existed and were  thought out to play by some music artists, 

but it was not accepted because it's not glorious or happy for their kingdoms to play in history.


It's still often common to hear 
Chinese and Koreans disliking such music as low, pathetic or not-done or uncanny. It was always been like that in China and Korea that putting your head up and boasting yourself along with others is expected to make harmony. 

Being humble as a lifestyle was  unpopular, and unaccepted except for authority. 

Nowadays its dislike is even more intense as it refers to Japanese music as ugly  because they ""deserve it"". All Just because of their own often hateful anti-Japanese overly nationalist grudges of WWII. 

Because in Japan such music was more accepted by the ancient authorities in history, in fact is a sign of low style humbleness and expressing ones sadness or gloomy feelings for society is more accepted than in fact  boasting ones self like others.
Sometimes Japanese play the happy ones, in most daily life usually in a peaceful way.

Humbleness of self depreciation is not just about obedience in Japan, but it's a valued quality of character.",Negative

The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is the visible remaining part of that destruction. The name of that planet was Mallona, Mallona means 'broken planet'.

Any politician, any military general, any human being I think should understand this story, the consequences of with which we still live with today and which perhaps with renewed fear since the end of the Cold War in the late eighties with the recent geopolitical realities as of late. What can I say. It is 3 hours of sometimes clunky dialogue, sometimes difficult to hear conversations, but also of awe-inspiring, moving, horrifying images, of nightmarish dread and angst and guilt, of suggestions of death on such a massive scale that it dwarfs the mind. Do not watch the movie if you are already feeling down, I think: I left the theater a shell of myself, haunted and seared, burned in a way, by what I had just seen. It is such cinematic power and strength, such visual poetry, and such a nightmare that will leave marks on you. The scene where Oppenheimer announced to his fellow Manhattan Project members that they successfully deployed the bomb over Hiroshima. The scene where they are casually choosing which cities to bomb. The entire ending sequence. Pure horror, pure visceral body-gut-reaction -sick-to-my-stomach dread and despair. It was such a PHYSICAL movie. It succeeded in so many ways of not just telling us things, but really making us SEE them, FEEL them, EXPERIENCE them. Not a perfect movie, has some flaws, but overall a masterstroke of anti-war, existential nightmare filmmaking. Wow. Bravo, Nolan.",Negative

Knowing how the minds of Babylonian white boys (the principle ones ruling over us) work â€“ and how they pulled a fast one on the world by releasing the movie Contagion in 2011 as a prelude to what they planned on doing in the future (in 2019) by releasing the Covid-19 virus â€“ one must realize that this new movie Oppenheimer has very likely been made for the same reason â€“ meaning â€“ as an indication of their future plans to drop another virus bomb upon the planet. The fact is that these boys arenâ€™t really that interested in making movies based on past history. And although theyâ€™ll used events that took place in the past to make a movie â€“ but thatâ€™s just to use such serve as a cover for what they plan on doing or are actually presently already doing. The fact is â€“ that about 8 years before they dropped the covid-19 virus bomb on the planet â€“ they made a movie not only about what they planned to do â€“ but in the movie they even gave the area of the world regarding where theyâ€™d drop the virus bomb â€“ meaning in China (see movie trailer - Contagion). However their first attempt (by way of the Covid-19 bomb) to eradicate most of us off the planet didnâ€™t happen as theyâ€™d hoped â€“ but one thing I know about Babylonian white boys â€“ they have not changed their minds or their plans to kill us all off â€“ and so the Covid-19 or some similar type of virus will be used by them again against us â€“ just wait and see.,Negative

Dialogue is an essential component of film, and audiences are trained to pay attention to it above all else.

Drowning out the dialogue gives us the sense we're missing something important, making it impossible to focus on anything else.

"I did not like this movie after liking the 80s version somewhat. But this version is boring, slow, with poor acting, simplistic dialogue, slow and uneven pacing and scene arrangements, weirdness for the sake of being weird, unnecessary closeups of actors, and the wrong choices for actors in the first place. I like my lead heroes to be big and strong and not small, meek-looking, and barely 100 pounds like Timothee Chalamet. This director should not be asked to do epic films anymore. They are too big for him, in my opinion. Zach Snyder (DC Comics) or the Russo Brothers (Marvel) might have had more exciting takes on the Dune saga. Denis Villeneuve's version was a waste of time and money, in my opinion -- the movie studio's money, and the money I spent at the box office and concession stand. I nearly fell asleep in the theater. Overall, this was a wasted opportunity! Finally, I am sick of people who say they love something when they know deep down it was really bad. That make us all liars and that goes for professional critics and ordinary people!",Negative

"â€‹Â @jean-claudelol563Â  You're either a fan of the David Lynch's Dune or a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune (which means being the fan of books and the new movies). The 1984 movie was hardly Dune. The tone was off, the literal point of the story was glossed over (the fact that Dune is supposed to be a cautionary tale), the acting was horrendous, the writing was awful and the ending was stupid (Paul became some weird godlike entity who could make it rain but still didn't knew that water kills sandworms). Not only Frank Herbert hated that travesty but Lynch himself did too.

Paul Atreides is supposed to be a ""15 year old boy"" who looks rather small for his age (novel Paul is even more of a twink than Chalamet) and this was written on the very FIRST page of the FIRST book. He sways the Fremen by exploiting the established superstitions using his prescience and by proving himself on the field, not by flashing his biceps. Your criticisms of the movie aren't even criticisms, they're nitpicks constructed around the appearance of the character and those nitpicks aren't valid nitpicks either considering they're stemming from your ignorance of the lore.",Negative

"Â @maazahmed506Â  I could not disagree more with your review on both the 1984 and the remake. Your opinion is backwards. The books were awesome though the first book was the best one of the series. The only thing I would criticize about the 1984 film is that it had to leave so much out. The movie is long but the book would take a tv series season or two to do it justice. As for this remake, I barely recognize the original Dune story from the book. Even having 2 very long movies with which to tell the story they managed to leave even more out of the film than the standalone 1984 version. Maybe in another 20 or 30 years theyâ€™ll do another remake and someone may finally improve upon the 1984 film. The remake left so much out and did not manage to include anything at all that might have been left out of the 1984 film. They even failed to include the Harkonnen Barronâ€™s fetish with boys that was quite well and tastefully included in 1984 and all but ignored in the remake. In an era where everything woke goes they failed miserably to capture a very important part of one of the main characters. In fact they practically left the Harkonnens out of the story much beyond the invasion, they were delegated to minor unimportant characters as were the tutors of Paul Atreides, Duncan Idaho, Dr Yueh, Thugir Hawat, all became minor almost irrelevant characters, I must have blinked because I donâ€™t even recall the Shadout Mapes, the Duke and Lady Jessica barely mattered in the story nor did the Bebe Gesserit Reverend Mother or their order. The only character they bothered to try and develop was Paul Atreides and it was pathetic. The Baronâ€™s nephews were barely mentioned. It was sad all around and a flop as far as I am concerned. Writing this response has made me realize this remake was so much worse than I had originally thought, I gave it too much credit.",Negative

There is nothing remotely recognizable in most of these characters (not even the way their names are pronounced) or the the plot points when compared to the source material.

Aside from the visuals of the worlds and the soundtrack I didn't like much of anything about this film. This train has gone so far off the rails it can't come back. I wish I were capable of ignoring the source material as a viewer the way the writers and director have done. Then I might've enjoyed it.

I dont want it to be a action movie i just like the science behind all this and its just not enough of that for me, its all about the politics and his feelings about doing this. i think they could have been more accurate with his doubts there are enough interviews to use as a inspiration. In the end you are right that this movie isnt what i expected but i wouldnt mind a science thriller about the manhatten project with some mor insights in building that damn thing . For me they just could talk about the physics and engineering problems and leave the politics for the end. There are so many sides to this story u could make 5 movies out it.

I wonder if Hollywood will have the guts of filming about him: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun

I wonder when the Americans will film the atomic bomb from the perspective of the Japanese, the first victims of the atomic bomb, and not from the perspective of ""the father of the atomic bomb"".

I expected that it would be a simple movie about good and evil, like many of the previous movies, and that Japan would be portrayed as the villain and discriminated against.

"Visually good but the only problem with this film is, it being a dialogue-driven film, music had to be just rightly mixed. Instead, they mixed it  too high that in the final act, it muffles key dialogues, to the point where you have to depend on subtitles. And I watched it even with headphones; no help. I don't know if this is a faulty disc mastering issue or a so-called pretentious artsy-fartsy choice, but overall ruined the film for me. Visually very good but it is a film, not a painting; has to balance every element. Tenet also had the same trouble but it was still ok and never this bad. And the reading of that holy book post-coitus was so weird and felt out of place; and her character was one of the most spectacularly annoying ones ever on silver-screen (even worse than Mona from FRIENDS)!",Negative
"Overrated movie, don't understand the high score on IMDB. Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era. Since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.",Negative

Too Political?

Too offensive?

"â€‹Â @Hunter_BrandonÂ   Most people focused on the execution of the movie and the action elements (which could be improved) but missed the most important thing: the symbolism behind it all

""The Matrix"" is much more than a mere action movie. It's replete with symbolism and meta-analysis about society, existence, and philosophical themes that require repertoire to understand

The bots concept, the archictect as a therapist, the blue pill as a medication, emotion as a form of control, the duality of Neo and Trinity, the synthient machines fighting each other, the matrix as a game right in front of people, the merovigian as a beggar and pissed of about this new superficial society, etc.

All of this has meaning and correlation with current times

IMO lots of people hated the movie cause they are in denial that matrix is actually talking about our era and our current problems

"Agreed. But, I saw this as the failed attempt to do a different type of trilogy. One that would've been viewed as a Tenet kind of vibe, with less Kung Fu. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity didn't know how to fight like that until they were virtually programmed to. Morpheus is gone. His program counterpart was code created by Neo, not the Matrix, so martial arts the way machines designed it for Agents MAY not have been similar. The machines repaired Neo and Trinity on a biological level, so that COULD HAVE included wiping their slates cleaned on some of their uploaded abilities. Neo's powers as The One they couldn't eradicate, thus choosing to use it against him. Accompanied by Trinity's anomalous empowerment towards it, they were able to give us the old Thomas Anderson before he became Neo. It's almost as if they reset the events of the first trilogy, and now we have the hacker programmer we were first introduced to, but with suppressed memories and the unshaven John Wick look. Bear in mind, Keanu and Carrie-Anne aren't in their 30s anymore, so martial arts stunts are limited. There should've been MUCH MORE gun fights though. Granted, it would've felt more like John Wick in the Matrix, but I wouldn't have cared. The one element I thought was dumb was bringing back Smith's presence. He was virus who was removed.

A prison in Antartica? The cost to fly there isn't worth the prison. A sub that meets the woman.  Driving down the spillway of a damn. The son that jumps from the car. So many stupid explosions and unrealistic events. Its just dumb. I have come up with a rediculous sequel as it made me laugh at the stupidity of this movie. Boooo!!,Negative

As with the servant, so with his master;
As with the maid, so with her mistress;
As with the buyer, so with the seller;
As with the lender, so with the borrower;
As with the creditor, so with the debtor.
3 The land shall be entirely emptied and utterly plundered,
For the Lord has spoken this word.

4 The earth mourns and fades away,
The world languishes and fades away;
The haughty people of the earth languish.
5 The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants,
Because they have transgressed the laws,
Changed the ordinance,
Broken the everlasting covenant.
6 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,
And those who dwell in it are desolate.
Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
And few men are left.

All the merry-hearted sigh.

"As someone who has traveled to the ME. The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbertâ€™s editors initially asked him to tone down the â€œMuslim flavorâ€ of his book. Trying to avoid Herbertâ€™s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity.",Neutral

"As someone who has traveled to the ME. The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbertâ€™s editors initially asked him to tone down the â€œMuslim flavorâ€ of his book. Trying to avoid Herbertâ€™s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity.",Neutral

"Â Elementary WatsonÂ  I know what the 4th wall is. ""Breaking the 4th wall"" means that a character is directly referring to the fact that they are in a show/book/whatever. This can be done by a character speaking directly to the viewer/reader, referring to the play they are into, to the audience, the fact that they are characters, or anything along these lines. More generally, it could be any direct influence of the fact that the story is a story into the story itself. For instance: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Little_Nemo_1907-12-01_panels_3_and_4.jpg

A meta-reference, on the other hand, is merely a reference of the fictionality of the work into the work itself, but such that on a literal level, it is not the case. An example would be a book character says ""we are not in a book"" or if I said ""we are not in a youtube comment section"".

Are you now convinced that I know what ""breaking the 4th wall"" means?

So the question is: does George understand that he is in a sitcom, and would he have said such things if they were not in a sitcom? My point is that yes, George understands that he is in a sitcom and tries to make Seinfeld realize that too. But George needs to be subtle, he cannot just tell Seinfeld ""hey we are in a sitcom, relax!"", for this would completely break Seinfeld's mind. We see here that the fact that this takes place in a sitcom has a direct influence on the course of the show. George would have never referred to a sitcom where they are the characters if they were not truly in a sitcom. For this to be a meta-reference and not a breaking of the 4th wall, George would need to not realize that what he says is true, which is obviously the case.

Dom and Brian, a duo so tight, Their bondâ€™s unbreakable, day or night. With every challenge, they rise above, Itâ€™s all about family, itâ€™s all about love.

The stunts are dope, defyinâ€™ the laws, Audiences worldwide, give applause. From muscle cars to imports sleek, The car game in this series is peak.

So hereâ€™s to Fast and Furious, the ultimate trip, A franchise thatâ€™s solid, never does slip. Itâ€™s more than a movie, itâ€™s a cultural hit, In the world of car films, itâ€™s totally lit.",Positive

"1 year old!!!

Thankful that this latest entry is way more fun and entertaining than part 9 being so downtrodden and halted by flashbacks
Thereâ€™s lots of parallels of fathers and their sons, the trauma in our lives makes us who we are, how do we choose the ones we save?
The action scenes are the most impressive from a giant ball explosive in Rome to two semi trucks colliding on a dam
Jason Mamoa is so flamboyantly fun being the most viscous, vile villain in this franchise so far
Brie Larson I actually liked in this as she sees the Agency has lost its true purpose
Iâ€™m so happy Cipher had much more to do this time and itâ€™s shocking Dante has way more power over her
Tej and Roman still have the most fun banter among themselves
It stinks it ends on such a big cliffhanger given weâ€™ve got two more installments to wrap things up and lots of the dialogue is terrible
But the mid credits scene thankfully will bring back a fan favorite from earlier movies and the resurrection of another beloved character believed to have died
Dominic has always had his family and he will never give up not even letting Dante attempt to break him
Can they stop Dante once and for all without being slain one by one?
Better than part 9 for sure but the last two installments might tell a different story",Positive

"This is not only the worst film in the franchise but also the worst film I've ever seen. 

I mean seriously what the fuck happened? I'm well aware that the F&F franchise isn't made for the Academy Awards, but honestly up to COVID these films have always had great entertainment value, so much so that they've been a guilty pleasure of sorts for me. But this abomination? This is the result from having a room of writers circle jerking to come up with the worst dialogues possible to jam into the most unimaginative, poorly executed garbage of story beats, so that they can stitch something together that passes for a poor excuse of a film. 

It's so blatantly, laughably awful that I'm honestly wondering if the Studio intentionally sabotaged their own production or if this whole thing was meant to be a giant meta satire. It's like they knew people would pay to consume whatever they put out without ever holding them responsible for having an ounce of creative integrity. 

It is such a shame to see this franchise sink this low.",Positive

A personal note: A few years ago I was sitting next to a man with a beard at a restaurant at Farmers Market in L.A. He was on a Kindle. I asked what he was reading. He said it was an obscure book that I never heard of. Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson. I impressed him by telling him I'd read the entire trilogy and rattled off the names of the other 2.
As we spoke, I told him he looked familiar.  He said he was an actor and had appeared in a number of things. I looked hard at him through the beard and got it. ""Does your name start with a....Duncan Meyer"" I said. I received a chuckle from Don McManus for that.",Positive

"Unlike marvel movies that pretend theyâ€™re smart and that they arenâ€™t stupid this movie has accepted the stupid fun which is more respectable than being in financial and hired writerâ€™s denial about the actual connected realism with normal human thoughts and behavior in writing, and the hired denial is marvel/disneyâ€™s problem because they hired acoustic and passionate activist individuals rather than expensive good writers like Tarantino, therefore this is awesome",Positive

It's core root is everyday situations any of us could get into, and how funny they are, but when you look at them objectively or try to explain to others, than can seem mundane.

"I just finished this show today and I'm in shambles. I was very depressed when I first started watching it, but it gave me the little laughter I needed. We all know how the world could use that. A little goes a long way. Needless to say, this show made me feel emotions I haven't felt in a long time. Emotions I was afraid to. Amongst all the laughter, I found myself learning lessons and being reinforced them throughout the show. It made me feel so much happiness, sadness, and everything in the middle all at once. So many wonderful things can really disguise itself in humor. Just like the Rose family, I was feeling really lost at the time. Graduating High School during Covid was a huge set back for me. And I ended up in a personal situation of my own I thought was impossible to overcome. But just like the Rose family, at the very end, I found myself somewhere. Somewhere special. And I've learned to be independent so this show has become very special to me. We never know what God has in store for our lives. And it's never too late to start a new chapter. I hope one day, I look back on these words, and remember just how precious these times were. Just like how there are better days ahead. This series really teaches you, that no matter how far the set back, you can always pick yourself up. And I find it so inspiring to look within and see how ""big"" the ""little"" things really are. I was homeless just like them, feeling like there was nowhere to turn to. But I found my place now. I found myself now. And you can only look forward. Thank you Schitt's Creek for being a part of my own personal journey. This show truly was something special. And I've been afraid of discovering something like that for a long time, but it only shows how beautiful life can be. If you have nothing you're afraid of losing, you have nothing to gain. And as much as I didn't want this show to end, I know it only means a bigger door is only opening. Much love to you all.

Imagine being swooped into a series of this magnitude that blesses you with a emotional heart felt experience. Family .. loving.. and worthy of watching the whole series out of surprise how it would end.. My wife and I had the blessed experience to be drawn into a super emotional experience.. The cast was perfect.. The narrative had us on holding back tears.. but they escaped into laughter and back to tearful compassion on a different level. This will be my only post because this series was needed in a world where we see Grammy's handed out in praise but it touches the hearts of millions who can relate.. You won my household award for a collective production of life as it should be..â¤â¤â¤â¤,Positive

"I was lured into this series with Eugene Levy and Katherine O'hare  .  I got addicted to this show after the first episode, A very eccentric comedy with a load of kooky, funny, eccentric well blended actors.  Chris Elliot is off the wall at his best.  Newcomer Annie Murphy is outrageous.   Dan Levy is in your face hilarious. 
My favorite is the ultra dry humor, cute and grungy tomboy  Emily Hampshire as Stevie Budd.",Positive

I got in on little fight and my mom got scared said your moving with your auntie and Uncle in Belair

I begged and pleaded with her day after day, 
but she packed my suitcase and said your on your way, 
She gave me a kiss and gave my ticket, 
I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it

First class, yo this is bass, 
drinking orange juice out of a shampain glass
If this is what the people of Belair living like,
mmm this might be alright 

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror,
If anything id say the discount was rare, non forget it yo home to Belair
I pulled up two houses, about seven or eight and I yelled to the cab man, 
yo home smell you latter

"I still remember the day this dropped.
I was in computer class not necessarily paying attention since it was a free day we could focus on work and I was just scrolling through YouTube before I saw this recommended to me.
""Marvel Studios' Avengers""
I already had multiple questions forming like ""Oh are they just calling it that? Kinda like a callback to the first film?"" and then clicked play.
I cannot tell you how I felt watching the whole thing only knowing what was being shown to me. Tony giving his last words, Thanos achieving his goal, seeing everyone grieve, wondering what plan they had in store.
And then the title reforming from specks of dust, to proudly display
""AVENGERS: ENDGAME""

"Â @skandamurgan4378Â  It's illegal in much of the West as well, but yeah you can still get away with it if you just use a VPN properly.

But if showrunners want money, they probably shouldn't force people who want to try the show out to download the show first and then maybe give them money afterward if they think to, lol.  Not too many people are going to DL a show, watch the first two episodes, pause, and evaluate from there whether or not they want to pay for it.  They'll just binge the rest of the freely-downloaded show, never feeling too compelled to pay for it.",Positive

"Something that won't happen, but should, would be a return to movie theaters of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME as a special double feature for Christmas of 2024. Maybe a two-week run. People who never got to see these movies in a real theater would line up in droves! Even if they already know every moment and every line from both movies.

Premier day was such a special day for anyone who went. We were on the journey from iron man till 2019 endgame. We laughed cried and cheered as it closed the story for our favorite heros and our ride. Infinity saga had its ups and downs but ended special for the fans.

"Why 2013. Why didnt I find this show earlier when it first debuted?? ğŸ˜­ I just wished I could have watched this 5 years ago because I was so much happier and more free as a late adolescent than an adult. Oh my god. I still love this show, I just wished I didn't have  to watch and also aware of the all underlying allegories to contemporary issues in society and in an adult's life (co-worker  relations, r/s - plantonic and romantic, professional, learning to deal and accept with reality e.g. Jake coming to terms with his father's apathy after denying this for his whole life), that I watch this and I identify so much with this show, that I draw parallels of what I watch with my life. It appeared initially when I first knew about this show on tumblr from gifs that it's mockumentary-esque sitcom, similar to The Office or Park & Rec. I started watching officially only last year and my initial take after 5 eps was that it was mildly humourous and light-hearted (without being over the top or in your face). I have since finished S2 and a few eps from S3 and I could see how the show have pivoted especially between s2 and s3. I  know I lament the timings I discovered the show, but I still love it. I don't have the disposition to sit through a drama or a book (works of fiction) because r/s generally tire me. But when I watch b99, I feel happy. It demonstrates that r/s between adults can be healthy and good when you are with good people. And this means a lot to me.",Positive

"Fresh Prince Of Bel Air Theme Song
    

            Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince
        

Now this the story, all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sitting right there
I'll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Bel Air

In west philadelphia born n' raised
On the playground is where I spend most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' and all cool
And all shootin some b-balls outside of the school
When a couple a guys they were up to no good
Started makin trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said: You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!
I begged and pleaded with her, day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave my ticket
I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
If this what the people of bel-air are living like?
Hmmm... This might be alright!
But wait I hear they're prissy, booze wine and all that that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there, I hope they're prepared
For The Prince of Bel-Air

Well I
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude looked like a cop
Standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here!
I sprang with the quickness like lightinin', disappeared
I whistled for a cab, and when it came near
The license plate said fresh
And had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought: Nah, forget it, yo homes, to Bel Air!

I, pulled, up to the house about 7 or 8
And yelled to cabbie: Yo homes smell ya later!
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne, as the prince of bel air",Positive

"One of the episodes ""Not My Pig, You Don't"", Will reads in TV Guide that Bill Cosby is getting a streetwise niece. This is a reference to Erika Alexander who joined the cast of The Cosby Show (1984) as Cousin Pam the same year that this episode aired. It's also a subtle jab at The Cosby Show for copying essentially the same premise as Fresh Prince Of Bel Air.",Positive

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss, and then she gave me my ticket
I put my walkman on and said: I might as well kick it!

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
Hmm, this might be alright!

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, uh
The plane landed, and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standin' there with my name out
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness, like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said: Fresh, and had a dice in the mirror
If anything, I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought: Nah, forget it, yo home, to Bel-Air

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie: Yo home, smell ya later
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",Positive

"5 years old!!!

My #1 movie of 2019
the culmination of 22 movies worth of story
directors Joe and Anthony Russo do whatever it takes like the characters say to wrap up this series of movies, a lot of these actors' contracts are over after this chapter, and it sets up more future stories for new players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
'Endgame' is the part 2 of the aftermath of 'Infinity War'; Thanos succeeded in his task to wipe out half of all life in the universe by collecting all the Infinity Stones thereby having our heroes lose for a change, now they're reeling from their defeat, licking their wounds, and learning to deal with the PTSD of it all
without giving too much away our heroes attempt to reverse the work done by the Mad Titan by working together but all too aware of the consequences involved, they understand they will only have 1 chance to fix everything if it can be done since the Infinity Stones are too powerful for 1 being
if there is 1 outcome they can come out on top then they will have to be ready to do whatever it takes
there's a lot of work to get through the 3 hour run time but trust me when I say it's worth building up to a grand final showdown between our heroes and the terrifying power of Thanos
not to mention so many callbacks to the many of the previous entries that fans will smile at 
the filmmakers actually do a brilliant job keeping a lot of this movies plot turns very secretive because so much stuff I wasn't expecting 

the Russo Brothers are breaking away from tradition and not messing around anymore as they show everyone learning how to deal with failure, tragedy, loss, getting new second chances, putting back together things that are broken, making unexpected breakthroughs, being about how much we have left, not how much we've lost, and letting things happen as they should no matter how much we're told to move on or start over
but the movie is the darkest and most somber of the MCU films put together given everything we've seen thus far
as I said though there's so many cheer worthy moments by the time the climax occurs which will bring smiles and tears at the same time
everything began with 'Iron Man' in 2008 but how does it all end exactly? it'll definitely feel like a proper conclusion with this phase of movies yet I am sad many of these players are done after this entry
still, it'll continue to make more exciting future stories for many other superheroes
this is an emotional but triumphant closing chapter for fans and critics whom have been with each of these films since the very beginning
thank you so much Joe and Anthony Russo and Marvel Studios for an incredible generation of comic book films that have now forever changed the landscape of cinema",Positive

"The most expensive propaganda machine in the history of cinema , more than 1 year relentless announcing the movie as the next big  blockbuster in the worldwide industry , end result US $130, 000, 000 , millions, this amount is not uncommon for a Hollywood movie release weekend , Avatar 2 $134 millions domestically and $ 301 millions internationally for a global total of $435 millions for the release weekend only, then it broke the 2 billion mark. Dangal made over US $ 300 millions, and Baahubali  made over US 200 millions, worldwide.Dangal made 2,023.81 crore, the only one over 2000crore, Baahubali 2 1,810.595 crore, RRR 1,387.26 crore and KGF 2 1,200-1250 crore.Gaslighting and  misinformation appear to be common in Bollywood, media feed false information to audiences, trying to re-write cinema history, sad and pathetic trying to undermine  other movies real achievements to create a desire narrative for another movie. I could continue naming US movies that had collected over US $ 100 millions over the release weekend  Top Gun Maverick US $ 124 millions, Black Panther 1 opened in 2018 with US $ 202 millions, Black Panther 2 opened with US $180 millions in tickets sales .Here in US if a movie cannot made over half billion US cannot be a blockbuster, therefore US $130 millions is not remotely could be considered a blockbuster worldwide nowadays all the blockbusters movies globally made over US half billion. Enjoy your national cinema successes but stop creating false narratives and emulating Hollywood, if you want to create blockbusters it begins with the public showing up at the movie theaters and paying for the complete  fare, here we do not have discounts because the movie producers are desperate for people watch the movies, and create holidays  discounts totally  unheard of it, people with their money and presence made blockbusters , respect for audiences is paramount.",Positive

"This is the MOST DECEIVING trailer and movie of recent times! Read the critics reviews before jumping on the hype like everybody! The movie is NOT about the atomic bomb, but whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not, and all the courtroom trials he had to face. Here the deceiving trailer shows you action, special effects, the preparation for the bomb, electrons and particles swirling around etc. I fell for it, well it's PURE DECEPTION because you will watch very little of these scenes. For ALMOST ALL of the movie duration you'll be watching boring prosecution rooms records, black and white footage - the movie is certainly not all in color as in the trailer... - and endless political debates about Oppenheimer's communist and union affiliations. All of this takes more than 2 hours of the 3 hours of movie duration, while here the courtroom scenes lasts just 5 seconds over the 3 minutes of the trailer (you can count them, they are at the end..), that's why EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS DECEPTION! It is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE of the recent years. The fact that it won so many Academy Awards it's because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit. At this point who really cares about the Awards and who they are given to.. And surely as hell it will be a long time before I watch another Nolan's product!",Positive

"I am Japanese.
I went to see this movie as soon as it was finally released in Japan.
I am a fan of director Christopher Nolan, and I was very interested in this movie because it is about the atomic bombing.
In conclusion, I thought this was a film worth seeing.
There are some scenes that affirm the atomic bombing, such as the city of Los Alamos celebrating after the bombing. (Well, I think it is natural for people to celebrate the bombing, considering what was happening at the time. It would be strange if they didn't.)
On the other hand, the film depicted the process of making the A-bomb, the experiments, and the selection of the drop site, which could never be depicted in Japan, and above all, Oppenheimer's anguish and regret over having created such a terrible thing were very interesting.
Despite this, some viewers see this film as glorifying the atomic bomb, but I don't know why they would think so.
What if Japan and the U.S. were in opposite positions? What if they had chosen not to use the atomic bombs?
Regarding the former, I think Japan would have used the A-bomb on the U.S. Regarding the latter, mainland Japan would have been the battlefield, my ancestors would have died, and I might not be here today.
As long as we cannot look into another world line, this is neither the best nor the worst outcome.
Whether it is good or bad, I personally think that it was an unavoidable choice considering what was happening at the time, and I believe that this choice is the reason we are here today.
Please note that this is the opinion of me, a tiny Japanese person, and not of other Japanese people, people in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, people related to the Hibakusha, or the Hibakusha themselves.

Finally, Einstein alone had a different aura about him, and even though he did not make many appearances, I got excited every time he came out.
Without Einstein, the atomic bomb might never have been created. But Einstein is also popular in Japan as a synonym for scientific genius.

"The importance of this subject is underrated, so the movie did it justice, it deserves more than Oscars, it deserves attention because it's a very important historical subject, relevant today with Russia threathening so it exeeds all expectations of a movie, a commentary on the atomic bomb, a history of it, an explanation of it for whom doesn't understand why it was invented in the first place, why it was important and necessary at the time, morality and war don't mix, so there it is and the future of it, it makes us think, thank u Mr. Nolan, what a brilliant work 10/10!",Positive

"Yeah huh but the west should always diversify and accept evryone cuz of the same statement over and over again ,(hey the white people did this did that for the last 200years). The UK ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ owes big time to everyone they ruled upon and oppressed for centuries, the US , and canda should learn from them and follow the same cuz they're white. What Germany did during WW2 they owe the humanity big time and should open gates for evryone to take a refuge . The Nuremberg trials which brought âš–ï¸ so nany N@zzi to the court of justice , the german state apologized to evryone for thr actions of 
H!tler But.......but  nobody absolutely no freakin body says the same thing about Japan ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ when they commited some serious acts of h0rrors during the WW2. Again!!  everyone remembers what The US did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki but no-one talks about 30million people' who got UnAlived ğŸ’€ğŸ’€by The Japanese.

"The movie is called â€œOppenheimerâ€, told from the perspective of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Forgive me if Iâ€™m wrong, but I donâ€™t believe that the real life Oppenheimer met Meitner? I would be interested if you could provide some information to the contrary, if available.",Positive
"Â @richesmovietrailers953Â  dude I donâ€™t care if they personally met. He is presented as a genius and Meitner got the same offer but denied to be part of the project moral reasons. Also Otto Hahn was shown and as far as I know they didnâ€™t interact either and her research was much more important. If you want to read sth interesting, then look into sources that explain how many times women have been left out in these â€genius and scientist storiesâ€œ youll spend time reading new info instead of asking me weird counter questions with nonrelevant reasons.",Positive
"â€‹@aileenzimmermann4921 nah, you are just obsessed with feminism and it clouds your judgment of fact and truth. 
Sure, women were treated like shit, but that doesn't mean they are more important to this story.

"Â @IeokkÂ yeah, I agree with you. Sure you could see it as a war crime. But the Japanese would never give up. We just kept sending men over there to die. The two bombs ENDED the war. It saved thousands of American soldiers, and maybe even some Japanese. If we didnâ€™t drop the bomb there would have been a full scale invasion of Japan and that wouldnâ€™t have ended well. Plus, the movie focuses on Oppenheimer and the guilt he felt for making the bomb. So stop trying to cause an argument and go watch the film.",Positive
I know what I am getting into.  I  expect well constructed scenes that go somewhere.  Watching Oppenheimer was about as stimulating as watching a 3 hour senate hearing.  The music was also awful. Â @MATDMixesÂ ,Positive
Why did i even watch it?  Because I like history.  Especially WW2.  The film was about as robotic and trite as the sex he had with his wife.  Â @MATDMixesÂ ,Positive

This movie and infinity war is the reason why we were able to watch at chairs for 5.5 hours straight. They better be as good as these were.,Positive
This film is proof positive to me that Nolan does not deserve all of the praise heaped on him.  Shooting this in Imax was a pointless waste of Imax cameras.  There was nothing in the script or visuals screaming for Imax.  If this was Lawrence of Arabia?  Sure.  Shooting 3 hours of essentially a senate hearing in Imax?  Why? And the bomb was a total dud.  Not impressed in the least.   Â @MATDMixesÂ ,Positive

"Japanese culture comes from Tang Dynasty in China, so Japanese characters are highly similar to Chinese characters. Japanese culture and China culture can understand each other. Although the music ""Sakura"" in the video comes from Japan, the pictures and texts in the video are from Chinese paintings. Therefore, it is suggested that you learn China culture first, so that you can understand Japanese culture more easily.",Positive

"I've just finished reading the screenplay and have not seen the film yet. The screenplay is very well written. My overall impression that some people including the FBI Belived him to be a traitor and agent working for Russia. they denied his security clearance punishing him, and president Truman was a complete dick. however, at the time he was creating the trinity project, he did not show an guilt or remorse about what he was doing and the cost to innocent human life because of the consequences of his work. he new exactly the damage the bomb would do he even selected the area and site the bomb would land. I would find the guilt of what i did unbearable. also, he took a huge gamble of biblical proportion when they first tested the bomb in the dessert. what right did he and american government have to put the whole world at risk of entire annihilation.",Positive

"Â @wakeup958Â  Yes, but Oppenheimer wasn't part of the bombing. He was part of making the bomb. This is about Oppenheimer's life during the time period the bomb was created. This is why we don't see any World War 2 stuff. It isn't about World War 2. It's about Oppenheimer and he wasn't associated with many action situations as this is a real life story.

"I am Japanese. My husband's family, who were survivors of the atomic bomb, lives in Hiroshima and I am interested in the atomic bomb, so I am looking forward to seeing this movie in Japan.

Regarding the movie, there seems to be controversy over the fact that it did not depict the damage that occurred in Hiroshima, but I don't think it is necessary to depict it.
This is because the best way to see the actual damage is to come to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and see the actual damage.

â—The atomic bomb was not dropped on a battlefield, but on a city where civilians lived, killing 140,000 people.
â—Victims included not only Japanese people but also many foreigners.
â—When exposed to the atomic bomb, the blood in the body instantly evaporates and expands, causing the skin to sag.
â—Even if their lives were saved, some died of leukemia a few years later, or committed suicide because they could not bear the pain of the after-effects.
â—The atomic bomb did not serve as a military deterrent, but instead increased the number of nuclear-weapon states in the world.
â—Vast areas of land in the United States have been contaminated due to nuclear tests and the effects of westerly winds.

â€¦etc.
There are many things on display that even I, a Japanese person, didn't know about.
I hope this film will give people around the world an opportunity to think about true peace.",Positive

"Disagree with you sorry, I found the last part of the movie too on the nose with all the exposition and scretching music but the character of Oppenheimer was fascinating I thought, the portrayal of the political climate for academics in the US during the 30s was interesting I thought and the way a man who didn't seem suited to running a team managing to deliver the trinity test I thought was at the heart of the movie. 
On the history side the allies were extremely successful at mobilising the best scientific brains they had to help win WWII, radar helped win the battle of Britain, the code breakers helped to gain vital intelligence, the Manhattan Project gave the allies a means to end WWII against a die hard enemy and also to deter any aggression from Stalin, by 1945 the red army was about 14 million strong, if Stalin had wanted to sieze western Europe he could have done if only conventional allied forces were there to defend it.
Oppenheimer after the war promoted arms controls as a way to limit the spread of the weapons, but once it became possible it would only have been a matter of time before the USSR created one.
Life in communist Europe was no joke, it was brutal and scary, even worse in communist far east countries.

Â @maazahmed506Â  I would love an extended cut. Maybe theyâ€™ll consider it after the release of Dune Messiah. Maybe after the theatrical versions have already released as a box set. It would be nice if Denis opened up to the idea of giving the fans a final/directors cut release. I wonâ€™t be holding my breath though.,Positive

Â @ShubhTheOceanÂ Yes. I would highly recommend it.,Positive
"Â @doctor.networksÂ  I have to see it again for sure. I might do so this weekend. I definitely caught myself nitpicking at part 2 more than I did with part 1. I think part 2 has a bit of a pacing issue compared to part 1, which feels more balanced. I didnâ€™t dislike it and Iâ€™m happy the story exists in a style on film I wholeheartedly appreciate. I just feel it couldâ€™ve been even better.",Positive

Idk why but I canâ€™t stop watching the trailer like itâ€™s prob the best movie ever,Positive
Refused to watch this because I knew I would be watching the movie and wanted to avoid spoilers. Watched the movie last night (opening night) and WOW WOW WOW!!!

Always will hit. Hits harder the more I watch it honestly,Positive
"Some actors have to be heard in their native language, not in the dubbed version. I know this effect from Robert Downey Jr. and Daniel Radcliffe and Cillian Murphy seems to have the same effect on me. Their voice conveys the role they are playing to a great extent.

Bakwas move. Nowhere close to part 1. All great actors but bakwas concept. Bhoot can fly and what not. All villagers accept that you can talk to bhoot and believe weird stuff. Nothing like part 1.

"Now I don't mean to say that the Marvel movies or the Flash/Mission Impossible/ Indiana Jones aren't any good -despite their criticisms they serve their purpose as entertainment . But every once in a while there comes a film like Oppenheimer and you see exactly what Scorsese meant when he referred to these films like amusement parks . They're fun but largely forgettable

Oppenheimer is the complete opposite - miles and miles ahead of anything that these films could hope to achieve . Every now and then during the movie a part of my mind as an avid movie goer kept saying that this witnessing film history in the making . I was reminded of Scorseses quote that despite a lifetime of watching film we've just seen what cinema could do

In its 3 hour run time there isn't a single frame wasted or.a single character that feels wasted. The acting roster feels like you're seeing the Classic XI coming out to play . The right combination of popularity and acting prowess

I was very happy to see Jason Clarke , Matthew Modine and even Gary Oldman in this .

Robert Downey Jr. Once again proves why he's a living legend and shows us fully the man beyond Iron Man

And as for the man himself - I have no doubts that Cillian Murphy is going to walk away with dozens of nominations and is the first serious contender for this years Best Actor Oscar . A lot of us film nerds have been rooting for him for a long time and were happy to see the man's stellar turn as the iconic Thomas Shelby and now with his portrayal of Oppie he takes that bar of excellence even further. I was reminded of the intensity of classic golden age Hollywood actors time and time again 

Very few directors have made me feel strongly about cinema- Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , Paul Thomas Anderson and Nolan 

Watching this film is like witnessing a live rendition of a classic musical piece by Mozart ir Beethoven",Positive

"3 years today it has been since The Batman came out. I remember seeing it with my late dad opening night, very snowy outside, cold but as we got into the theater, it was all excitement. As the movie got done with, my entire theater clapped after what they saw! Then I saw it two more times in theaters. My dad passed away this past November and this was the last movie him & I saw ever together back in 2022. I carry that memory with me as the end of the film with Batman being a beacon of hope, that was my last film memory with my dad. 

When The Batman Part II comes out, that will be in his memory.",Positive

"Man, considering how many people flipped out when Pattinson's role was announced, still seeing him as the ""twilight guy"", it warms my heart to scroll through the comments and see none of that.

Granted, the dude has been in so many incredible films in the decade after twilight, anyone that's seen his work would have agreed that he was the perfect choice for a dark gritty batman.

I've personally never seen any twilight films but have seen him in a bunch of other excellent movies, so I was stoked about this from the start",Positive

Nice Movie From The Trailer,Positive
"Okay, yeah, Hollywood at the limit. This trailer alone reveals US mainstream thinking that should make you shudder. A tear-jerker dripping with fantasies of omnipotence, historical misrepresentation without measure, devised and staged by monstrously overbearing world explainers. And because they can wrap it up so colorfully, we now believe everything they say. Even after the greatest genocide of the indigenous people, they claim world domination in thought and feeling. JF Kennedy 1990: ""My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man."" With ""world"" the Americans always mean themselves! ... just: ""Universal Pictures""",Positive

Cillian Murphy deserves an Academy Award this year. I can say it by watching the trailer.,Positive
"Just watched Nolan's Oppenheimer. It's like, way more of an anti-war flick than a straight-up biography. I mean, history will remember Oppenheimer as the dude who birthed the nuclear bomb, but is that what he really wanted to be remembered for? The whole movie tackles that question head-on. There's this one sick line where he's like, ""I've got blood on my hands."" He created something hella awful that ended up snuffing out the lives of over two hundred thousand people in Fukushima and Nagasaki. In the movie, it's clear as day that Oppenheimer can't revel in being called the ""father of the nuclear bomb"" or bask in his fame. 'Cause he's got that gnawing guilt inside him that messes with his moral compass. Can Oppenheimer ever find forgiveness? I guess it's on him to forgive himself, and we'll never really know the answer to that question.",Positive

The movie was just as advertised, a character drama epic with a phenomenal ensemble cast and the surehanded Cillian as the lead. The movie is called Oppenheimer, not Fat Man and Little Boy, that movie sucks anyways, maybe try seeing it with less of a primal mindset and delve into the psyche of Oppenheimer",Positive

Just watched this masterpiece today. Clearly the best work so far from Nolan. Brilliant acting from Cillian and Downey. The cinematography and the direction was on a whole new level.The BGM throughout the movie gives chills and is so perfect. And ofc the Christopher Nolan X factor at the end. Now get the deserving Oscar.,Positive

I caught a flight that afternoon and crossed the International Date Line before the day had ended and flew into the beginning of Spring in the Western Hemisphere.

And to be honest, Cillian Murphy has been my most favorite actor since Breakfast on Pluto. So, it was amazing. Mostly thanks to Mr. Murphy. Just looking into the camera until the person behind just can't handle it anymore.",Positive

"Â @juwe7143Â  point of the movie is clear. I'm not talking about ""point of tge movie"" or ""who is Oppenheimer"".
Ok, as you (obviosly) don't get it, let me describe you this way:
1) everyone is talking about fantastic dish. It's made by one of the most recognisible chef. Everyone who tries this dish, says it's fanrastic, it fabolous. It's a sensation. Then you finally have a chance to try it. You got the dish, took a first bite, and you find it - bland. No taste, no salt, no pepper, no any spices or texture. Ok, maybe it will be in another bite. Again, the same taste. Then you wait for a minute, maybe it will be some aftertaste. Nope, nothing. Ok, you grab one more bite, maybe you got the ""wrong side"", but again - nothing. Tasteless. Will you continue to eat? I will certenly not. Then you share your opinion, and some guy tells you: ""Well, you should eat everything, later it will be better!""
or:
2) your friend has a fantastic car. He tells you about this great ride, fantasticly comfortable, great looking, fast and it sounds so good. You come one day to see his car, to take a ride with him, be he cannoz start it even after 20 minutes. But, he swears that it is a great, fantastic car. After 20 minutes, you leave thinking ""what a sh*tbox"". But, he swears that it is a fantastic car. When, and if, he starts it.

Btw. I studied mathematics and physics, so do not worry about my knowledge. And that's exactly why I find this movie bad. Again: if it has nothing to keep me seated at the beginnig - it's a waste of time.",Positive
Reminds me of the pink Sakura flavor Kit-Kits.  Delicious.,Positive
Â @dmitrecicÂ  you can't make demands to make the movie more fun. then you just shouldn't go ğŸ¤¦,Positive
"â€‹Â @lostbrawler68Â  you missed the point. Thing is: nothing is happening at the beginning. There is nothing to keep you seated (except money that you payed for the ticket). There is nothing to tell you why some scenes are important. At the beginning story goes everywhere and nowhere. ""Fun"" means that it should keep you interested to watch the rest. But here is nothing. Literally - nothing. Again, what happens later, I don't care, as the beginning is complete waste of time. 
Such a fuss about ""a masterpiece of movie"", and ends up as a garbage.
If you like it - good for you.",Positive

"Â @juwe7143Â  a good movie will keep me in suspense, or made me wait for some answers to the questions raised at the beginning of the movie. Or at least they will ask some questions at the beginning of the movie. No sense, no fun, no questions in the first (as you said) sixth of the movie, without any sign that even one question will be set in the next 20 minutes. I saw a pair of tities. Again, without any context (they meet, they are having sex, tities are there, then she get up from him, browsing trough the books asking nonsense philosophical questions). When there is nothing at the beginning of the film, then you have no need or desire to waste time any further. For me, the movie is a failure. Or to watch it and rewind to interesting parts. Or even better, you review the film, cut it and edit it into a meaningful and exciting story.",Positive
"Cillian Murphy CILLED IT!!! Cillian's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was absolutely LUMINOUS. Then again, Cillian is brilliant in all of his roles. Other standouts are RDJ and Emily Blount.

And FYI, TGM had a 6 month run in theaters and was 1 of the biggest movies in the post Covid era that ACTUALLY did bring many older audiences BACK INTO THEATERS. I thought all this is basic common sense stuff and public knowledge, not my fault if you can't even understand that and are so offended over God only knows what!",Positive

"I was so eager to go and wach this movie. Expected, at least, it will be fun, or to learn, see something special.
After 30-35 minutes I left the seat. It was literally wasting of time. 10-15 years ago, it would be B movie.
Such a shame. It could be great movie.
After (trying) to watch it, I was so curisous to compare it to ""Barbie"" (movie with bad story). And surprise, surprise, Barbie is a much better movie, as a whole, than ""Oppenheimer"" which should be a spectacle!
So dissapointed.",Positive

1. See it for yourself. 
2. I understand why Japan boycotted it. They didn't show nearly enough respect to the victims. I kept wondering when were they going to show respect to the victims. 
3. It was underwhelming but very well acted. It wasn't because it was a biopic. Id have to guess Nolan didn't want the bomb and its destruction to be the big action of the movie. Almost exploiting it to sell ""action"" . So, i can respect that because of the lives that were lost.",Positive

"Oppenheimer certainly is for me the best film of the year and I hopes it wins many awards when awards season comes around again. Cillian Murphy was great, as were the other cast members, especially the actor who played Edward Teller, father of the Hydrogen bomb, and Gary Oldman playing President Truman.  Although just a cameo role, Gary Oldman plays the  President as well as he did with Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. My favorite scene was when Oppenheimer met Truman at the White House, saying he, Oppenheimer, had blood on his hands following the A bomb attacks. Truman was, to put it mildly, not pleased at all about this, saying  he was the one with blood on his hands, as he was the one who authorized the attacks, NOT Oppenheimer.  To quote from the film Truman says â€œDo you think people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki give a s- about who built the bomb? They care who dropped it. I did. Hiroshima is not about YOU.â€
This meeting between Truman and Oppenheimer really did happen and Truman was indeed angry about what Oppenheimer had said.",Positive
The best movie of year,Positive

The 70mm IMAX was simply magical. The first time, I felt Nolan gave his best, a good film for sure.

"Don't believe what  Christopher Nolan says.
""On Oppenheimer film""

 Thus, Universal and Christopher Nolan excluded over 80% of the filmâ€™s vfx crew from the credits. Why? Who knows. It certainly wasnâ€™t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldnâ€™t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (Itâ€™s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEGâ€™s facilities in India.)

Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists arenâ€™t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.

In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random â€œproduction babiesâ€ who didnâ€™t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.

OppenheimerÂ is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed toÂ Oppenheimerâ€™s success arenâ€™t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.

This piece was updated on July 25 with additional information from DNEG about the use of vfx in the film.

"Wow, so much to say/think about this edition of the Dark Knight. I remember days of classic cartoons featuring Batman, like ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" and the Adam West Burt Ward TV show with the great color-costumes of live-action pow, and then came Tim Burton and the Animated Series (on Fox), which were watershed! Christopher Nolan and Ben Affleck gave it nice spice no doubt too. This one featuring the Riddler is both eerie, jarring, graphic, dark, pensive, Realism and neo-modern with classic touches here and there. Jeffrey Wright is good in this too, good supporting character IMO. Batman's surpassed Captain America, no? Batman is officially the strangest super-hero out there. I compare this worlds-graphics trend in Batman-media to the turn we saw with classic (Laurel and Hardy) to modern (Farrelly Bros.) comedy imagery...all humanist. Quite cool.",Positive

"The movie is 6/10 and unnecessarily long. I regret going into the theater to watch it, should have just waited for it to come out on streaming services. Unlike Inception, the movie is based on a pretty straightforward plot and storyline, but Nolan had to make it more convoluted than it needed to be. I feel the movie could easily be trimmed to 2 hours and still deliver the same effects/results. 
The number of characters in the movie are also unnecessarily huge and hard to remember. Nolan failed to demonstrate the importance of many characters in my opinion. They are just there. 
There are also a lot of the scenes not really tied together. For example, in the first 10 mins of the movie, it keeps showing Oppenheimer throwing glasses into the coroner and seeing molecules movement, Nolan didnâ€™t really built those scenes into anything significant. I assume those are just used to show Oppenheimerâ€™s intelligence, but the whole scenes feel chaotic and messy.",Positive

"The Nolan movies played a massive part in bringing Batman as a character back into the live action mainstream. The way I see this movie is being a grounded interpretation of what Bruce would have been like in his early days. People respect and loge Batman because of how humans he is, yet in films they expect him to be superhuman. Batmanâ€™s â€˜superpowerâ€™ has always been his wealth as a baseline, but also his relentless determination and ingenuity. In a more grounded fictional world, you canâ€™t expect him to become a legend overnight. To me this feels like a refreshing portrayal of what Batman and his first steps into greatness would realistically look like, especially in a live action portrayal.",Positive

"Visually and audibly, it was amazing but you can still tell how difficult it is to transition the story to film. Many scenes couldâ€™ve used more work by trimming shots in the first half of the film and lending more exposition to scenes we came to see in the last half. Especially Paulâ€™s transition to the Lisan al Gaib, which I expected to be a lot more powerful. Timothy did a great job portraying his transformation but I was missing the visual piece to believe it. The first film was very good at adventurous story telling and world building as well as giving us Paulâ€™s visions, which helped us see what he was experiencing. Paul drinking the holy water shouldâ€™ve been a bit scarier, showing us the old memories to come inhabit his brain, possessing him. Also, why did he not use the Weirding Way? Especially against Feyd? Where were the Bene Gesserit abilities we came to see? Jessica felt more terrifying than Paul did.
The major battle scenes couldâ€™ve benefited from having a few more shots as they seemed too quick to pass. I wanted to rewind the film to see it once more. The final event felt a bit rushed. Overall, the film was great for a general audience but for hardcore fans, I feel the first film was balanced better in making you believe the world you were temporarily suspended in. The second film felt more like a military film, which is fine and makes sense but it needed more strange and more scary. We certainly got that from the Harkonnen. 
I think Iâ€™m okay with Alia not being born and the change made to Chani feeling betrayed by Paul. I donâ€™t understand why Thufir was cut. I donâ€™t understand why Mentats were all but missing from the film.",Positive
I know it ends well but I do hope they make one more. This series is the best thus far for newer movies.,Positive

Nice movie.. More expected insecond part,Positive
They are starting to ruin one of my favorite stories of all times. They did not stick to the original story line at all. Focused more on his girl then on the main character. And they neglected to show the original fight seen. He destroyed the harconen not the other way around as was shown in the final fight seen. Great graphics is pretty much all I can say. If the 3rd part does not get back to its original story line I doubt many true fans of the book will call it a good movie. The first one was great. I can not say the same for the second part. They will destroy this movie just like they did to the Dark Tower movie. because of the graphics I give it a 9. but because they did not stay true to the story including the fact that his lets call her wife received more attention and they changed her character completely from agreeing with him all the way and giving her a role that was never mentioned in the books it drops down to a. I am so dissapointed. The best on screen version of this series was the sci fi channel series.,Positive

The chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga is electric, and their characters are so complex and compelling. The film's exploration of mental illness is both sensitive and unflinching, and it raises important questions about society's treatment of those who are different. If you're a fan of psychological thrillers or character-driven dramas, this is a film you absolutely cannot miss.",Positive

"SPOILER ALERT continue reading only if you have already watched.



I think Joono is Amrita, Shiva's mother, remember when Shiva was a year old and their apartment got on fire, Amrita was engulfed in flames, i believe that was Dev's doing, but not to kill Amrita or Shiva(anyway Shiva is immune to fire) his purpose is to capture Amrita and put her under his control so she could be his puppet to help him collect the 3 Brahmastra parts and set himself free. Also Joono keeps on saying that she has to do it because it is the only way she could be free, also the markings on her and the color of her eyes are obviously Dev's doing to control her. and notice how they never showed Joono dying, just her falling off the cliff, which we all know not that fatal especially to powerful beings like them, and the most important and biggest giveaway for me is that Joono's power is water, and we all know Amrita's power is water. she is the strongest water user that could go at par against Dev. BUT! if Amrita is indeed already dead, then that is such a bummer considering she one of the strongest beings that could defeat Dev.",Positive

"Guys I figured out why Agnidev aka Brahmadev was in subconscious stage for so many years and why he lost to Amrita despite being so much powerful and possessing both the powers of Agni and Jal along with certain other powers. Brahmadev didn't lost to Amrita, he lost to his love, fiance Amrita, and that was intentional. Only loophole of all his powers he got is LOVE. That's why even when Brahmastra was about to destroy the universe, innocent love of Shiva and Isha made their way to survival. My theory is when Dev aka Brahmadev got all the powers and about to destroy the world, sages conspired against him by letting Amrita go and fight against him. Sages knew the only loophole of Brahmadev. See you people on 2025.",Positive

"This film has a good plot and vfx. But dialoges are so bad i felt like these actors doesn't even know to act , its not their fault .i think the problem is with the dialoges. Also lack of character development. Vfx is good .if there is a 2nd part they need to get good  writers i feel.",Positive

"FYI this is not rokudan no shirabe, but rather it is midare, as it was titled by the very person who put together the album this song was taken from. If you listen to either composition youâ€™ll notice that they are quite different and easy to tell apart. 

In fact an easy way to tell this is not Rokudan no Shirabe is with the sequence of notes starting at 1:22 which are not at all present in any other renditions of Rokudan Iâ€™ve heard. 

But if you listen to other renditions of Midare like the one by Kimio Eto, youâ€™ll notice this same sequence of notes appear. Why? Because this piece is Midare, not Rokudan no Shirabe.",Positive

"SUGGESTION FOR TEAM BRAHMASTRA
 
I would recommend Mohit Raina for the cast of DEV . He will look good as hero in love story with Amrita and he will look killer as villen also, and I think he will slay at dialogs. Bollywood ke heros acche hain magar Dev ke role ke liye I guess koi fit nahi baithega aur Tollywood ke heros ke muh se dialogs Utne acchd nahi lagenge .

BTW I lovedd the movie pleasee part 2 me bhee aise hi VFX , aise hi cast aur itni hi mehnat karnaa

Keanu Reeves, just speechless over his incredible performance everytime which just gets better as the next John Wick releases. The cast was the best picks and had they been other actors it would not be as big and popular as it is, just wow. JW4 blew my high expectations out the window, the movie is the best action movie I have seen since JW3! Brilliant all around and to everyone included in making this masterpiece, this is a movie everybody remembers years ahead and it is so impressive that each chapter has been thoroughly entertaining throughout, there is no bad John Wick movie.

"I can't believe nobody has picked up on this yet so I will say it here. The scene shot from above as Paul moves through the huge crowd of Freman is a visual reference to him being the Kwisatz Haderach. In Dune part 1 Mohiam says ""Like sifting sand through a screen we sift people"". The scene from above resembles grains of sand with Paul sifting through them and being separate because he is the Kwisatz Haderach that the Bene Gesserit have been working towards all those years.",Positive

"Im very critical regarding psychological thrillers, Split was the first movie i would experience as exceptionally good.
Joker being the next one, it's been 2 years since i've seen it and its about time i get to experience it again.

Exceptionally good movies are worth waiting years on end to go for a second or third run, it removes key parts of the excellent movies where i get to re-experience it again.

Joker is soon on my watch list again, after 2 years of refusing to watch again.

LETS GOOO!!! rewatch a masterpiece!!!",Positive
"Well just watched the movie right away from 12 am as soon as it got released in hotstar, kudos to the entire team of brahmastra because down the line I have faith we will be blown away by the storyline and I don't have to say VFX of course it was way above expected levels. We have a great story unfolding infront of us and there's so much room for character building. I'm only having high hope's from here let's do it. Now coming to the few improvements to work on first the main story needed a little bit better narration with a little more screen time maybe 30 odd mins more, first half both the actors seemed dull,  emotions and expression were below average that's understandable because it's a new and challenging genre for both actors and hopefully it'll be worked up in future, the child artists were on point and lastly the build-up of Dev was the best part of the movie and in the next part I'm waiting for a spectacular magic to happen with narration and Dev's character building, well dunno about others but I can proudly say it's was a great attempt, the entire team deserves more. Good luck ğŸ¤",Positive

"An original DC story about a good person slowly transforming into the evil Joker over time, eventually becoming Batmanâ€™s nemesis. In many stories, the Joker is older than Batman. A clear example is the Jokerâ€™s wrinkles and his posture in The Dark Knight (2008), which resemble the stance of a man in his 40s. If we assume Bruce is 9 in the movie and the Joker is 33, Bruce would become Batman at 23, while the Joker would be the known villain in his mid-40s ğŸƒ.",Positive

"I just watched this great movie yesterday before I went to sleep and let me tell you something, the hype for this movie is very much real. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I was impressed for once. Being a Dune fan, I had high expectations for the first movie which (probably mostly because I wasn't paying enough attention) felt really slow and boring.

But this gem stood out and was completely different from the first movie. I loved everything from the beautiful story to the acting to the action scenes. Everything flowed perfectly together from beginning to end. 

If I were to nitpick on something, it would be more variation, as most of the movie focuses on Paul and the Fremen in the desert. It got tedious at times and I felt that the movie lacked story in-depth. Nonetheless, I still felt the movie did a good job focusing on the Harkonnens and their situation as well. Feyd was especially a pleasant surprise, as he was very badass, to say the least. His ruthlessness and coldbloodedness can't be denied to the point even I was surprised by his zero tolerance.
 
All in all, this movie is a masterpiece. A 10 out of 10. I actually played Dune II, my favorite RTS game of all time right before watching Dune Part II so that should tell you how much I love this series, whether it's the games or the movies.

So yeah, if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it because you won't be disappointed!",Positive

"I know alot of people have been raving about this movie and I get it, they made a good attempt. The special affects were brilliant but they didn't focus on the continuity of the movie.  In my opinion the movie was very superficial, it had a predictable plot but was also too confusing at the same time. It was too long, there were scenes that were prolonged for no reason making the movie seem like it was dragging at times. The characters kept explaining what they were doing and why, even though it was obvious which also wasted time. The team seemed to think that the audience are idiots which was annoying and offensive. There was no need for any of the songs which again wasted time. I think the only song they really needed was the last one with the training montage. They focused way too long on the love story angle (which again wasted valuable time they could have used on the actual plot). I get it love conquers all. But they could have included the love aspect without overpowering the film with it. For example in spiderman far from home and no way home. We knew how much Peter loved MJ and that he would do anything for her but it wasn't constantly shoved down ur throat. They are not constantly explaining to each other and everyone else that they are madly in love. You see the little things they do or say while the story is unraveling that makes u realise how much they love each other. This is different it feels like they will stop the progression of the story to show everyone this is love and when they have done this for a few minutes they carry on with the movie. All I am saying is my young neices and nephews who love superhero movies and was really excited for this one fell asleep half way through. That says it all.",Positive

"This movie reminds me of American psycho

Maybe bc they wanted to show stories ab women who can think for themselves instead of following men blindly? Idk. I know nothing ab the books but this right here was good story telling to me bc it showed how some ppl justify their hunger for power by calling it love.,Positive

"I watched this in IMAX and then in 70mm for my birthday, and damn, was it a beautiful cinematic experience and worth watching in a theater, especially in 70mm. I didn't even want to see it again not in that format, but I went back and saw it in just regular theaters one more time before it leaves. For the 70mm we were so cramped in that theater it was packed nearly full, but seeing it with everyone's, everyone's reactions to what was happening, gasps and people sitting up on the edge of their seats, it was just a beautiful experience and what I think we should be cultivating more of in storytelling and cinema. Denis is keeping it alive.",Positive

I must say muadâ€™dib riding the worm was my favorite scene and how it affected Chani and Stilgar fit their characters. For chani is was pride relief and excitement all rolled into one. For stilgar he is literally watching prophecy come true before his very eyes and looks overwhelmed. Not confirmation of decades of belief but stunned and overwhelmed at the same time. Just spectacular. You can almost feel this is what riding the controlling a giant worm would feel like and look like and it just so happens to be the biggest one anyone has ever seen.,Positive

Ekdam Bakwaz Movie ğŸ¤£ğŸ˜› Guruji was on run worried ğŸ˜¯ about safety but suddenly the Romeo Juliet decided to play ğŸ† fireworks. No  good story except fluid effects of VFX. Long time wasted just to play with fire expectram and song with it. Most of the time were spent just on commentary of the story rather than making a movie on that story. As if we are hearing story rather than watching it. Just adding great actors and childish VFX doesn't turn a useless story into a movie.,Positive

"Best film with few bummer here & there like
1) Nandi Astra potential not presented to the fullest, beside having 1000 Nandi power   struggling & not able to throw the truck down the hill in one move, it's looks like joke
2) in Deva Deva song grass & tree not getting burn
3) in last scene after complete attachment of Brahamastra, Ranbir's shirt burnt but not pant ğŸ˜, these are little mistake but not major
Apart from these Good points like
1) This is the top-notch graphics in Indian cinema till date
2) Big B is top reason to watch & Big B's last action is far better
3) Screenplay
4) Arijit Singh voice â¤ï¸
   I hope in next installment, they come up with Bang by correcting these little bummers & make it available in 3D.

And, tepid acting and by the numbers Other World story arcs aside......please, for the love of chemical chance, can this sludh be the final appearance, pretty please, of invented languages which are blatant Jabba the Hut ripoffs.

"As someone who worked in Sudan for many years, this series and the books that it is rooted in, is unashamedly about Arabs, their culture, heroes, and their experiences of colonialism, great power tussles, and the struggle for their resources (oil is pithily presented as ""spice"" for example). I only wish that peoples from the lands that inspired Dune were included as actors, script writers, and consultants. Many of the names and concepts that are descriptive of awe inspiring elements like the ""eyes of Ibad"" and ""shai hulud"" and the ""mahdi"" are mispronounced, even if they are placed in a historical context that is basically correct. I hope they draw more on the indegenous cultures and peoples in the next series. But a must watch nonetheless.",Positive

"A ground breaking film in every regard.... however I can only see the next Joker film being a diminished version of this, particularly with Stefani Germanotta copying Joaquin Phoenix (because she was such a fanatic and wants to inhabit him for her own attention) the same thing she did when she was suppose to do a tribute to David Bowie at the brits, but made a complete mockery of it by making it about her ğŸ™„. I can see this film being made around the Harley Quinn character and not the Joker and his other movie with Ridley Scott (Napoleon) being based around Vanessa Kirby's character rather than the actual movie. Such a shame that great directors, actors, editors and script writers have to allow this madness for the sake of the insane-woke agenda and woketards, this has already impeded on the quality and greatly impacts the integrity of the film.

Thank goodness we would still have this one, untainted!",Positive
"I vividly remember working as a Security Guard in the cinema when this masterpiece was released. It was winter im the UK and the nights were getting longer. The cinema was around a 20 minute walk from my house so I would walk most days as it was convenient. The first time I saw Joker, I was genuinely petrified to walk home after work. Most of the location that the movie is filmed in resembles the route I would walk to and from work. Considering I was doing a 10 hour shift which started at 2pm till 12am it was a horrible walk home.

The whole message was that Arthur needed better help from the system, but the wealthy were keen to discard him. The entire point of the movie clearly escaped you.

Even Jaoquin Phoenix, the man who plays Joker, is staunchly liberal and is a political activist trying to educate right wingers about the folly they support.",Positive

I just watched this movie for the first time and I kept waiting for that one thing to push him to his psychotic break and that didn't happen. His lines about his life not being a tragedy but a comedy really sum up his mental state throughout the movie. The way the world has treated him has been tragic for so long that now its comedic. Also the double meaning because a Shakespeare Comedy is a tragedy,Positive

"Just watched the Indian movie ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" on December 5th!

I think ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" is also a great Indian movie!

This movie, let me see a responsibility for ""belief in the heart""!

If, every artifact (regardless of its appearance) is equivalent to the duty of ""strength, protection and cherishing""...

The above is just a ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ fan who likes ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³movies would like to say to the staff and actors involved in the production and performance of ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva""!

Looking forward to the smooth production and release of the second film!

By the way, it might be interesting to add a little ingenuity and design to the ""movie credits credits""!ğŸ¤”

do not know why.....
If the playback speed of the ""End credits"" of the ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" movie is slightly accelerated,

"According to hindu religion, the Brahmastra, Agniastra, Narayanastra and other Astras are indeed highly destructive.

But there are several more important and powerful things that the Devtaas, holy Tridev and Tridevi possess that can nullify the destruction of these Astras easily.
 
These things are :
1. 8 Ashtasiddhis great powers 

2. Kamdhenu - wish fulfilling cow 

3. Kalpavriksha - wish fulfilling tree 

4. Mahadev's legendary Naagmani 

5. The nectar of immortality Amrit

6. The Chintamani gem that gives lots of worldly knowledge 

7. The Sanjeevani ressurection knowledge 

8. Power of huge boons granted by God or curses of holy sages
9. The holy Vedas 

10. The power to see and control time

11. All Tantric knowledge and powers
 (create magic protective shields and nullify attacks, know magic mantras and their abilities, acquire magic objects through rituals, communicate with spirits and ressurect or liberate them, shapeshift, transfer powers to a being, etc..) 

12. The many forms of OM ( Tridev, AdiParashakti, 10 Mahavidyas, 9 Navdurga, 19 avatars of Mahadev, 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu, 8 forms of Lord Ganesh) that create and sustain the universe. 

All the astras are inferior as compared to these 12 things. 

This proves that having these destructive astras are not such a big deal because the destruction created by them can easily be amended or controlled by the holy sages, Devtaas, Tridev and Adishakti.",Positive

The word riding scene and the Harkonnen spice harvesting sabotage were awesome. The whole movie was great but Denis really nailed these two action sequences. Dude is an absolute master of his craft.,Positive
"Not that into the whole John Wick thing, however, this was action packed, as they all are I'm told, and well written except one totally unbelievable scene when he leaps from the window and lands on the VW bus below. He would have died upon impact from breaking his back and neck. That was not something any human would get up and walk away from. My favorite scene was when he shot the guy (just before leaping out the window) for almost shooting the dog. I still need to watch the other chapters from beginning to end to get the full affect of John Wick. 
Keanu said he was tired after doing these films and needed to end them. He's such an amazing actor.â¤â¤â¤",Positive

It's only movies don't get attached cause when it's time to view the thing the result is the result and you can find lot better.

"John Wick 1 & 2 are good. Hated 3. Over the top and just violence for the sake of violence. A revenge series turned into some superhero fantasy shit which just has no realism whatsoever. And I have yet to see 4. But will do. I think it's a franchise that is well overrated in my opinion. The fight scenes are superb but the whole spectacle is just way over the top for my liking. Saying all that, Keanu Reeves is amazing, as usual. Each to their own.",Positive
"I love this movie but I think they need to end johnâ€™s story here. Expand the universe if you want, but all great (anti?)heroâ€™s deserve a great ending. This was his. Bring him back for flashbacks if you must, but not every characterâ€™s story needs to stretch on forever.",Positive

"Was disappointed with Chap.4! Loved the first three! The almost 3 hr run time didn't bother me  BUUUT.....Bill Skarsgard's character wasn't a very convincing villain, Shamier Anderson as the ""tracker"" was really corny, and Weston's over the top tan (LOL) were three things I couldn't get past in this one. Honestly, even though I enjoyed them, there were way too many (and too long) fight sequences in this film that didn't jive well w the bland story line! A 4 hr run time (to balance out all the fight scenes) would've been justified if better dialogue and more convincing main characters (as mentioned above) were present. The tires ran flat to the finish in this franchise!",Positive

"John Wick is one of the best action movies I've ever seenğŸ‘ŒğŸ» If I want to evaluate it, of course, I will say 10/100â¤ï¸â€ğŸ”¥ I love John's character because he is good at everything and all kinds of fighting, and he is a loyal man in love, but his style of killing and he doesn't leave anyone as much as life, his banner always attracts me to complete the movie(Dana nooh)",Positive

"This was the audition for highlander, the church at the beginning, the ""who is this ?"", the table, epic swordfights', and closest thing to the Matrix Chad has been given the green light to do, that 100 million budget will grow to 200 million at least. The new Highlander and Immortals will be like tackling 50 man-eating lions, i saw this trailer online and even my fiancÃ© was saying wtf is Highlander. Henry will be 5x more ripped than Superman for sure, and Chad has given some teases but he is not telling, if Chad pulls it off and that is a big ""if"" he goes into the major Director category in my worthless opinion. It is free reign to make human people inhuman. And hopefully, it will be very successful, I think Keanu will feature as an immortal. Most of all Henry C is going to be the most ripped man in cinema history. ""Under the old laws, only one can survive."" - yeh they are paraphrasing that line from Clancy Brown !!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH",Positive
"A great fan of KR and was really looking forward to enjoying John Wick 4, but it fell flat. The action scenes in the glass mirrors was a repeat, the falling down the steps (all of them!), the blind man who miraculously could shoot every target perfectly, JW himself bouncing off cars, buildings, and bone crunching assaults to be able to walk around without any problem just became a yawnfest after a while. And the final duel scene was obvious and only surprising that JW hadnâ€™t turned to use his bullet on the ğŸ¦¨. Lucky there is no #5 â€¦â€¦.. unless â€¦â€¦â€¦ never say never! Even the daughterâ€™s reappearance was overdue in the script. If it can be called a script. ğŸ™ˆğŸ™ˆğŸ™ˆğŸ™ˆğŸ™ˆ",Positive

"I just saw this movie today. If you were hoping for a movie that adheres to the major character and plot points of Frank Herbertâ€™s genius novel, prepare to be very disappointed! If you were hoping for a sweeping, briskly paced, action packed, science fiction epic that tells a thrilling story, then you will be very disappointed!Â 
If you were hoping for a darkly lit, â€œwokeâ€ commentary examining the perils of being a hero, the unfairness of colonialism and the use of the term, â€œSouthern fundamentalistsâ€ till you want to beat your forehead against the wall, then this is the three hour torture session you have been yearning for.",Positive

"The John Wick universe is so unbelievably ripe with unique and interesting characters, plots, relationships, etc to the point where they could go anywhere they want with it. The Ballerina is a good start and a good example. They dont even necessarily need John Wick/Keanu in the movie for it to be interesting. The world that they crafted can carry its own weight at this point. So much so that they could really just pick any of the characters that they've introduced (or havent) out of all the John Wick movies and make something out of them. Theres been so many points when watching these movies where someone says something or someone is introduced and I'd say to myself: ""I'd watch a movie about that"". I really hope they take advantage of what they've created.",Positive

"Â @maazahmed506Â  I will continue to disagree. I have watched the 1984 version of Dune dozens of times over the years and I am sure I will watch it at least a dozen more times in my lifetime. With this remake, once was more than enough. It was horrible, down to the lead character, a twinky looking, sounding, acting manchild that is supposed to come and liberate and lead the people of Arakis to create a new order and lead the known universe. It fell far short of convincing in every aspect of the film. All I can say is some of the visual effects were decent but given what is available these days even that could have been far better. I am just glad I got to screen it for free. I would have wanted my money back otherwise.",Positive
Perfection Â¡  Thank you sirs,Positive
"â€‹Â @jean-claudelol563Â  You can't lump every detail into a movie. The objective of an adaptation is to include as much detail from the source material as it's organically possible and without affecting the writing negatively. You'd have a rushed Marvel-esque Dune movie at your hands if you included everything A to Z in a 2 and a half hour movie. It's something that Lynch's Dune suffered from.
Baron's fetish is an unnecessary detail and doesn't pass in a pg-13 movie today. 
There is not much about the Harkonnens to show beyond their role in imperium politics and the erasure of house Atreides. Baron's nephews were literally two major characters in the second movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Have you even watched the second movie? Lady Jessica is literally the female lead of the second movie after Chani and her role in the movie is possibly the most crucial one considering she was the one who radicalized and manipulated the Fremen to rally them to Paul's cause
What I do agree on with you is that Dr Yueh and the Mentats were underdeveloped, I believe that too was a choice made to preserve the runtime since because there is simply no way you're getting a 3 hour movie that goes over every plot point and comes out good. It was necessary to keep the runtime short to garner the audience. Otherwise, Villeneuve shot about 4 to 6 hours of footage in part one alone and more than half the movie's original runtime which included several important scenes were cut in the post-production. While an extended cut will certainly elevate this adaptation the movies are still great. Much better than that Lynch version.",Positive

I managed to see it 9 times in the theater.  No franchise can surpass John Wick.  I am grateful.",Positive

big fan of the books and story. The best parts of Dune 2 you can see in this trailer...many of the scenes are self indulging on good sound and screen effects - but each of the more passive scenes are just elongated unnecessarily (not that someboy would miss them in the storyline), as if Vilneuve had to fill 3 hours and his buget of 190Mio. wasnt enough.
The ""action"" you might expect after Dune1 and all the looong preparation in Dune 2 is more than sparse  and would have made this film to be watched a 2nd time... but yeahh ""professional"" critiques seem to love the great pictures but forget the pace, plot and action (even the books are offering more action!).

"This movie is so underrated,I have watched this movie in the theatre,It is just awesome.",Positive
"I don't think any movie series demonstrates style over substance like the Wick franchise. The first one was a lot of fun and well done. After that it's just been highly stylized ultra choreographed fight scenes that find new ways to kill people. JW4 takes that yet another level with axes, arrows, bladed of all kinds, incendiary rounds, etc, etc. There's literally no plot other than same plot, he has to work his way up the food chain of bad guys to be free.

Some of the visuals are outstanding and entertaining, some were clunky and some poor CGI showed itself. I found the blind swordsmen trope ruined by this movie, and the need for the suspension of disbelief turned to max to keep watching it. From all that you'd think I didn't like this movie.

In the genre of mindless ultra violent fun over the top fight scenes, it's a good movie. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed. I'm over those kinda of movies at this point and I think in the genre of utterly over the top ultra violent movies with great (and I do mean great!) amazing fight scenes, yet has humor, character development, etc, done for a fraction of the cost, Hardcore Henry is my pick.

As to John Wick 4, seen one you seen 'em all but those who like the franchise: A-",Positive
Watching JW1 to JW4 is intense yet fascinating how the story evolved and the casts are magnificent. This action movie is once in a lifetime roled and molded to be the most outstanding ever.. Great Job to you allğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘,Positive

The plots got more intricate , each  baddy was better than the previous one, every new character introduced , whether a small or large part , was superbly done by the actor and the fight scenes just got better and better. Now we all knew that this was to be the last John Wick film , but WOW what a final twist to the John Wick character  . Who would have seen that coming ? I tip my hat to all of those involved in the making , of this amazing film franchise.",Positive

"Fun Fact 
There are 3 Bollywood actors who played a character for a very long time 
SRK as Mohan Bhargav ( I hope that Mohan Bhargav was not just an reference and he was the same Mohan Bhargav frim Swades )
Mukesh Khanna as Shaktimaan ( he will return in the New Shaktimaan movie and I think he'll give his powers to a worthy person )
Hrithik Roshan as Krrish well he played Krrish for more than 16 years ( its confirmed that Krrish 4 will release soon ) and if we'll include Koi Mil Gaya then he worked in a franchise for more than 20 years ( I am not including koi mil gaya coz both Rohit Mehra and Krrishna Mehra are different personalities but if Rohit will return as a flashback charecter in Krrish 4 then yes )",Positive

"They should of stopped after Chapter 2. This movie really stretches credibility to the impossible. Wick (and most of the other combatants) get shot many many times, to NO effect! I get how their suits are a kevlar weave, but seriously?! To be that effective, they'd have to be wearing Ironman's armour!! And a blind assassin?! Keanu's acting is very wooden. Always has been. But no new dialogue at all ""i need a gun"" :) At nearly 60yrs of age, Keanu is still reasonably competent at the hand-to-hand fighting stunts. But he was noticably less so in this movie.  Please...no more sequels. Count your money guys, and be happy OH! the best character had to be..Scott Adkins!  Wearing a fat suit, and still kicking the shit out of Wick! He looked like he really enjoyed himself.",Positive

"Only one question needed answering for me, just how was Wick not dead from the end of 3? Shot to the head, falls off a roof, cracks his head and neck on a dumpster at the bottom...it is simply not possible to recover from that, so they ignore it. Some weak nod to Fishburne is not enough, and that blemishes the movie from the start as there are no real physical consequences for John. The guy shouldn't be walking yet after the end of the original, let alone this, so that ruins the movie from the start. Too bad, but they shouldn't have ended Parabellum so viciously; and enough with dogs on command as killers in these films, too. He had a sweet puppy of hope, not a grown KP partner, in the original. It's insulting to see how much the love of a dog and his redemption has been tarnished here. As for blind men with guns and how they get around in new places with gunfire everywhere, not even Donnie Yen is that good. Glad I got to watch this for free, I sure wouldn't have paid much for it.",Positive

1 Timothy chpt. 6
16who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whomÂ beÂ honor and everlasting power. Amen.
THEN CHRIST OUR LORD  SPOKE TO ME IN A GENTLE VOICE THAT SOUNDED LIKE MANY AND SAID THE NUMBER 7 TO ME AND IN THE SAME DREAM I WAS ALSO GIVENÂ  ISAIAH CHPT.13 

Isaiah 13Â â–º
King James BibleÂ ParÂ â–¾Â  

A Judgment against Babylon 

1The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 

2Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 

3I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger,Â evenÂ them that rejoice in my highness. 

4The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 

5They come from a far country, from the end of heaven,Â evenÂ the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 

6Howl ye; for the day of the LORDÂ isÂ at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. 

7Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: 

8And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their facesÂ shall be asÂ flames. 

9Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. 

10For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. 

11And I will punish the world forÂ theirÂ evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 

12I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 

13Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. 

14And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. 

15Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joinedÂ unto themÂ shall fall by the sword. 

16Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 

17Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; andÂ as forÂ gold, they shall not delight in it. 

18TheirÂ bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. 

19And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

20It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 

21But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. 

22And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons inÂ theirÂ pleasant palaces: and her timeÂ isÂ near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.",Positive

"The  JW films  so far (1-3) had their appeal...had a good premise....but  at times  bordered on being tantasy when i think the idea was to  make JW  ""realistic""...al the training they put Keanu rhough.

What  I found odd  and mising was  that JW didn't have a ""sniper rifle"" yet he wa an  ""elite level assassin"".  I'm guessing  the  ""sniper rifle"" would be the 41  weapon for an  ""assassin""??  To be good at not being seen....like a  ""ninja""  SHOULD be...""neither seen nor heard""....as much as spossible.  Even int he  Jason Bourne films they did have  JB behind the scoe of a sniper rifle--CHECK. 

Assassins I'd think would also be masters of diguise.....

Only problem i had with JW1---the Russian mob  just walked into JW's ""lair""...unheard. Shuld be layers upon layers of  traps and alarms...and seceral quick escapes for JW....and to  beat him within an inch of his life  in thebeginning???  How was he going to recover  to do the rest of the film??   H should have been  handicapped after that beating if not killed...if not killed forced to do his kills from a distace--snipr rifle...no way he'd be able to  ""hand to hand""..etc. 

Sniper rifles  are i think  ""standar issue"" for assasins :)) The Professional.  THe American (clooney).  Sniper (Tom Berenger).....Odd  Crusie's character didn't have  one in Collateral.",Positive

"Â @Kuhmuhnistische_ParteiÂ  Yeah I am aware of that. I just wrote 10,000 AG (as stated in the first movie) because I didn't want to explain the entire Spacing Guild lore thing to him.",Positive
"Yeah ok, lol.",Positive
Bb3 trailer se better hai yeh,Positive
"Personally I loved the tribute paid with the radio DJ, thatâ€™s stems right from the 1979 movie Warriors. Then you have the box of shotgun shells labeled dragons breathe going back to Keanuâ€™s roll in Constantine when he was given dragons breath as a weapon, and of course you have Clancy brown playing the harbinger who says â€œin the end only one remainsâ€ an homage to his 1986 film highlander where he played the Kurgan. I absolutely loved these little throw backs subtly put in there",Positive
"It seems to be at the level of Mozarts music, was this created with modern western harmony or is it entirely a product of japanese culture?",Positive

Bb2 better than bb3,Positive
That was 165 minutes? I didn't feel it much when I watched it. I got surprised when I learned that the ripped nephew is Austin Butler lol,Positive
This trailer was still better than Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3,Positive
This trailer is way better than be BB3,Positive
The tuxedo suit s the hero. Without the suit their is no John wick universes. Non of the action is possible without that suit,Positive
Paul Greenhouse changed the rules for actoon/violence with the Bourne series. John wick takes the format to such another level. Complete perfection.,Positive
"Theorethically you could, but i don't reccomend it. You'd loose on important world building and the pay-off wouldn't be as great. I'd reccomend watching the first movie beforehand or AT LEAST watch some recap on youtube. That being said, part two is an amazing movie in it's own right and if you decide to see it, you will want to watch part one as well.",Positive

I simply love this 2nd part, but I had this feeling the entire duration of it",Positive
Like Johnny wicks films,Positive
"This movie, oh my God. Just watch it if you haven't already.",Positive
My 76 year old mothers favorite series of movies is the four John Wicks lol,Positive
You know it's a great movie when you re-watch the trailer,Positive
What an excellent finale,Positive
"ivan flores Listen to the Stasimon chorus from Euripides, it has a pretty similar kind of sound",Positive
can you share something about that ?im curious,Positive
"God, I am so happy I didn't watch any trailers leading up to this movie. It makes the movie that much better.",Positive
I had my mind blown when i watched this movie in Imax... what a experience it was ... Fantastic sound effect,Positive
I started reading a 2400 sites book series because of those movies! Thank you Denis :],Positive

Seasons in the Sun is such a good soundtrack choice for this trailer!,Positive
"Watched JW4 twice last week. Its the best action movie i have ever seen. We can watch all those action multiple time without getting bored.. And i like the way they give respect to all actors of this movie.. Especially Donnie Yen.

"Americans and their French British counterparts

Same old story your movies are quite quaint and cute.


Real cute.",Positive
"Jesus is the way, the truth and the life who believes in him even though he dies he will live forever.",Positive
The movie was a joke,Positive
A huge let down from part 1 2 and 3. I get the impression of a desperate man fighting to save his skin rather than a doting father fighting for the memory of his wife. Action sequence sloppy with too many scissors take downs and no original action sequences. Mediocre at best.,Positive
Brahmastra better than 100x adipurush,Positive
like 2000 years ago :D,Positive
"@lionsgate, I know you guys get thousands of comments and millions of emails but this is the greatest adventure I've ever seen in my life. the aerial camera scene at the end is the greatest thing I have ever seen in any movie. Every single movie in this series keeps getting better and improving upon the previous one, I have no idea how you guys are doing it but thank you so much for your work. I am in love with the 4th one. You outdid yourselves. Everything is so stellar I'm just at a loss of words and almost cried at points out of sheer amazement of your work. The first one was my favorite, then the second one, then the third one, and now this one. I don't even know how you keep on improving and finding unique takes on the series. I love your work. I also immensely love the blind guy starting in on the action at the beginning. It was so slick. This movie felt like something more than a movie and I've never said that in my life. I kept on watching the third one over and over while waiting for this one. I actually waited to watch this one because I was savoring the moment as odd as that sounds. Every single moment of acting was literal perfection as well. I'll be watching this one for quite a while. You guys put me in another world while watching and thank you and thank you for reading my comment.",Positive
I wish everyone could see this movie like u do. This movie is amazing,Positive

"Wow....just wow.  The storyline and action was just amazing.

I love how they have Chinese, Japanese, African American, Middle Eastern and European all in this Super ACTION sequel.

I must say it's One of the Best or the Best ACTION Movie I've seen in a long time.

Donnie Yen was Amazing in this movie so was the rest of the cast.",Positive

Thank god I haven't watched it yet. It seems awful.,Positive
"This movie is an expierence and a freaking masterpiece (and way better than the trailer indicates)! Ive already given up on blockbuster cinema since I hate everything that Disney and Marvel have produced in the last 10 years, but this movie is like a breath of fresh air. I gained hope again that big productions can also be good movies, something which I thought to be impossible in 2024. 
Blockbuster cinema is dead; long live blockbuster cinema!",Positive

Last night i watched John Wick 4. This movie is a masterpiece and in my opinion the best of all 4 movies. All 4 John Wick movies are fantastic and a real masterpiece. Thank you for 4 masterpieces. ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ’ªâ¤ ğŸ¬ ğŸ¥ ğŸ“½ ğŸ  ğŸ”,Positive
Quite frankly I thought part 1 was way better. There just seemed to be something lacking. in part 2. Where were the pulse weapons and the weirding way found in the book and where was his sister Aliyah? I know the books are usually better than the movies but this just seemed to be lacking something. I still think the 2000 TV inseries overall was and is the best. The story sticks close to the books; the cinemetography is immaculate and it is well acted.,Positive
"We watched today with my sister and brother and a friend, it is really great Acta, Story an Special music and Computer Animation. Thanks.
Complimant ğŸ‰",Positive
Canâ€™t wait to download this for free from YTS MX torrents,Positive
"Just watched it and itâ€™s frustrating how the people survive countless bullets at close range, they somehow donâ€™t get hit, I know itâ€™s action but wow atleast it shouldâ€™ve been believable. Took me 3 days to finish it, wasnâ€™t really interesting FOR ME.!!!!",Positive
"A lesson fom John Wick: ""Don't mess with a mans dog"".",Positive
"Alia was still in Jessica's womb because there was no 2 year jump in the movie. I think that vs a talking 2 year old on screen was the right call tbh. Agreed, books will almost always be better than their movie adaptations",Positive
â€‹Â @furchikÂ No thanks.,Positive
Â @OmnipotentEntÂ  I still say that the 2003 mini series is the best of all. I will not revisit the 2024 part 2 at all. In my opinion it is unsatisfactory & had they wanted to do Dune justice it should have been done in 3 parts.,Positive
"Â @furchikÂ  Go on. Put your theory to the test, you know you really want to, be brave ğŸ˜ğŸ‘",Positive
"Â @rfurdayleeÂ  no, i dont want to, bc chance of surviving is not 100%, but anyway it is possible to survive it, u just not enough smart to know that i guess.

and also as i said i can give u a link for a bodycam video where a guy got shot in the head, it penetrate through his head and he runned 2 miles for help and he lived",Positive
Â @furchikÂ  Give it a try yourself. See how common it is. If you don't get back to me I will take it you failed. Good luck you might need it ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤ğŸ˜‚ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ğŸ‘,Positive
"Â @rfurdayleeÂ  wdym? its not like in video games, theres a chance where u can still will be alive while getting shot in the head, i saw bodycam footage where person got shot in the head, bullet penetrate through and he runned like 2 miles to call help, it happens with small calibers, if u dont believe reply and i will send this video",Positive
you should be!!! Japonic culture is truly exceptional gift to the world!!!,Positive
God damn i like the classic japanese musik.,Positive
â€‹Â @furchikÂ Easily a million to one to survive a head shot.,Positive
